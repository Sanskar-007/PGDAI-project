201,201,"After the Delhi Jal Board office in Chhatarpur was vandalized on Sunday over the ongoing water crisis in the national capital, BJP's former South Delhi MP Ramesh Bidhuri said that the people can do anything when they are angry and it's natural.

The water crisis in Delhi has sparked widespread protests, vandalism, and intense political confrontations across the city. The Delhi Jal Board office was vandalised by some BJP workers in the Chhatarpur area on Sunday.

Referring to this, Bidhuri said, ""It is natural. People can do anything when they are angry. I am grateful to the workers who controlled those people. It is the government's and the people's property. There is no benefit in damaging this property. I appeal to people to not vandalise public property.""The BJP leader further accused the Aam Aadmi Party of corruption and said, ""This is a corrupt government. They are trying to change the narrative to protect themselves from corruption charges. There has been no audit of the Delhi Jal Board. It is at a loss of Rs. 70,000 crore. This is a corrupt government. We put forward our demand to be free from this government.""

880,880,"NEW DELHI: If reports are true, it seems that BJP central leadership is finally waking up to the mood on social media.

As was reported by OpIndia.com earlier, many BJP supporters had started getting disillusioned and disappointed with the party as they felt that their opinions were not being heard.Now the party appears to have realized that they need to actively involve their supporters on social media.According to a report published by Hindi newspaper Amar Ujala, central leadership of BJP has asked its state unit in Delhi to give tickets to those persons who are active and popular on social media.Although it’s not yet clear if the party is planning to choose a totally new and fresh face amongst its social media support base or it’s just asking ticket hopefuls to be active on social media, it’s clear that the party is now keeping social media in its electoral equations.

It will be a game-changer if Delhi unit of BJP actually give ticket to someone who’s popular and influential on social media, apart from being active on ground too. This could placate angry and disappointed supporters, who would think that they have got one of their own to raise their issues.

Earlier, many supporters of BJP had trended #BaggaVsAK49 and demanded Tajinder Bagga of Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena to be given ticket to fight against Arvind Kejriwal. Bagga is one of the popular BJP supporting Twitter user who has also done ground work.

There are other contenders too, but before that BJP will have to officially confirm this news and invite its online supporters to apply for tickets in the upcoming assembly elections in Delhi.",Right
36,36,"The Supreme Court on Friday refused to stay the Bombay High court judgement passed on June 27 upholding the validity of reservations granted to the Maratha community by the state government. The reservations have been granted under the socially and educationally backward class category (SEBC) in government jobs and educational institutions.

However, the apex court said that the quota created as per Maharashtra SEBC Act passed last November cannot be given retrospective application with effect from 2014.The bench led by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi was hearing a plea by a group of social workers, academics and representatives of the Muslim community who have appealed against a Bombay High Court decision upholding a “one-person or one-community” Maharashtra legislation providing reservation to the Maratha community in education and public employment.

The petitioners, led by Mohammad Sayeed Noori Shafi Ahmed, asserted that the Maharashtra legislation is against the very tenets of equality enshrined as a fundamental right in the Constitution.

Advocates Vipin Nair and Madhavi Ayyappan representing the group of social workers, academics and representatives of the Muslim community who have appealed against a Bombay High Court decision, contended that the high court decision was seriously erroneous and based on incomplete data.

A Division Bench of Justices Ranjit More and Bharti Dangre of the Bombay High court on June 27 had upheld the validity of the SEBC Act which was enacted on the recommendations of the State Commission for Backward Classes headed by retired judge Justice MG Gaikwad. The commission was constituted under the Maharashtra State Backward Classes Commission Act, 2005.

The Act was passed by the State Legislative Assembly on 29th November 2018 granting 16% reservation to Marathas.

Several petitions were filed against the SEBC Act and the Gaikwad Commission report on the ground that the 16% reservation granted to Marathas violated the 50 % cap prescribed by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Indira Sawhney v Union of India.

The Bombay High court had observed that the 50% ceiling could be exceeded under exceptional and extraordinary circumstances and the reservation was based on justifiable data submitted by Gaikwad Commission. However, the court has asked the state to cap the reservations at 12% for jobs and 13% at educational institutions.",Center
1329,1329,"Karnataka was about the survival of India
In looking to their own basic survival, the people of Karnataka have saved India. They have saved democracy            Years ago, one of my editors had told me, as I was graduating from a rookie to a reasonable starter, that India was a very complex country – I could not hope to understand it all on my own without help from the locals wherever my assignments took me. Then post-liberalisation when there was talk of foreign media houses entering India and news magnates who were owners of various news organisations egged journalists to protest, the same editor spotted me in a crowd of newshounds  shouting slogans.

He took me aside and asked, “Do you think any foreign news agency coming in will be able to adequately cover India without any help from people like you? They will need locals to understand the country or else will be defeated by the complexity of our nation, just as you might be defeated by Bihar or Tamil Nadu without help from local journalists there.”

Some years later I had a sense of dèja vu when a politician who was a Union home minister told me the same. From his perspective every state had different layers of castes and social hierarchies and no government could hope to keep the peace unless and until they decided to wet their feet among the people and had implicit faith in their local leadership to help them negotiate all the mazes and local  landmines. Then he added a codicil – “It is not just that as a home minister I should trust the local leadership. But the local leadership too should have faith in me. They should know that I will never betray them and that their interests are my interests.”

The results to last week’s Karnataka elections  brought home those  wisdoms to me in quite a different context, both with regard to the Congress and the BJP. I think Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra contributed a lot to the Congress’s stunning Karnataka victory. But it may still not have happened had the party’s local leaders not sealed their differences, closed ranks and put everything they had into their victory with their national leaders backing them full tilt, going where they asked them to go, meeting who they wanted them to meet, fighting a battle, literally, of life and death for not just Karnataka but the whole of India.           On the other hand, the BJP relied almost entirely on their central leadership, more particularly Narendra Modi who, in turn, made the election entirely about himself (they abused me 91 times – which, of course, Priyanka Gandhi could counter with the many more number of times he had abused her family). Or else he relied on equating Bajrang Bali with the Bajrang Dal which many Hanuman bhakts like me would have found so very off-putting as we all know the   Dal is nothing but a bunch of goons, murderers and mosque destroyers (I have it first hand from a Bajrang Dali that he and his team were atop the dome of Babri Masjid with hammers knocking it down in December 1992).

I wouldn’t go as far as to say Bajrang Bali rained his wrath on Modi or the BJP in Karnataka but one must appreciate the fact that India and its politics is very complex and varies from state to state, even region to region within a state in many ways. Bringing all those various differences into a cohesive whole is always the responsibility of any central leadership and no where was this more visible than in Karnataka.

It was not as though there were no differences at all among local leaders in the Karnataka Congress but we could see how they rallied round their central leadership who, in turn, deferred to their better wisdom and judgment on micro issues. The less said about the BJP leadership and ticket distribution the better.

However, the Karnataka results also brought to mind what the same Union home minister had told me all those years ago – dashing from east to west to north-east to south, to north and then to north-east again,  month in and month out to quell many outbreaks and turmoil among various people, he had come to the conclusion that at the end of the day just about every body wanted just one thing – survival.

“But survival, far more than an identity, depends on a livelihood. And basic to that survival-livelihood is roti, kapda aur makaan. Then come bijli, sadak aur paani. Only after all these needs are satisfied could they even begin to think about a political identity. If we fail to address those six basic issues, we are doomed.”        Soon after this conversation former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. Elections had to be suspended mid-way. When campaigning resumed Atal Behari Vajpayee arrived in Bombay for an election rally. One BJP corporator, who was later gunned down by unsavoury elements in the city, touched his feet and said, with great longing and anticipation, ”Saab, is baar hamein satta milegi, naa!”

I have never forgotten Vajpayee’s reply. “Tum yahan baithe satta ke sapne dekh rahe ho aur hum isi chinta mein doobe jaabrahe hain ki hamein kain vanvaas  nahin lena pade!”

Neither that BJP man nor any of the reporters around understood. When we asked, he explained. “The Congress manifesto is full of basic bread and butter issues of the people. As against that we talk only Hindu-Muslim, Mandir-Masjid. Admittedly, we were playing on sentiments and emotions of the people. But when a laadla neta like Rajiv Gandhi gets assassinated in such a brutal fashion, our sentiment gets overtaken by their sentiment. What are we left with to convince the people that we can see beyond the mandir-masjid to their basic needs?”

Predictably, the next BJP manifesto had bread and butter issues of the people written in but now the party is back to milking the communal divide and religious sentiments. In contrast, in Karnataka, it is clear, hungry stomachs, livelihood and basic needs that the Congress promised to address quite overtook the religious sentiments of people from all communities, given the micro numbers now emerging.

As the Union home minister had told me then, “Only when you have a full stomach would you have time to look at issues that are not basic to your survival.”

But I think the very survival of India was at stake at these assembly elections in Karnataka. In looking to their own basic survival, the people of Karnataka have saved India. They have saved democracy. We all live to fight another election, another day.",Left
1741,1741,"The story of Ram’s militant makeover
Substituting the calm image of Lord Ram with the wrathful image of him fitting an arrow into his bow to shoot the ‘wicked’ sea god                       Readers may well recall that while the new Parliament building was being built, the ruling dispensation had tendered a series of clarifications in response to accusations of the aggressive ferocity displayed by the lions in the giant Ashoka Pillar hoisted on its roof. Those clarifications had elicited only one response from the experts: “If only they were credible!”

The truth is, they were not credible for several reasons. The first and foremost reason was that by then, PM Modi and his government’s involvement in the dazzling machinations of the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) and its affiliates in transforming our cool and calm, peaceful and patient, inclusive and reassuring religious and cultural symbols into aggressive and wrathful ones had reached such a crescendo that all social graces and limits had been forgotten. If there was anything new about this ‘promotion’, it was the targeting of our national emblem.

We might understand this better through the fact that during the golden period of its Ram Mandir movement, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, an affiliate of the RSS, had left no stone unturned in substituting the serious, calm and courageous image of Lord Ram — as depicted in the popular Shri Ram Panchayatan — with the wrathful image of him fitting an arrow into his bow as he prepares to shoot the ‘wicked’ sea god for refusing to clear a pathway to Lanka.                                    Today, while one might debate the success of these manoeuvres, one can definitely not say that the VHP had even the slightest regard for the sublime images of Lord Ram that have long existed in our traditions and are deeply ingrained in the minds of our people.

Had the VHP so desired, it would have known that  Ayodhya’s past is witness to the fact of preferring Lord Ram pictured as a source of perennial bliss, a king full of love for his subjects, kind, empathetic, equable and morally conscious, over the persona of ace archer, slayer of Ravan and conqueror of Lanka.

The reason being that when Agradas — of the fourth generation in the disciple tradition of Ramananda, founder of the Ramanandi sect — started the Rasik sect in the 16th century, most of the saints and mahants of  Ayodhya had become his followers.

Anantananda was one of the 12 major disciples of Ramananda, whose disciple Krishnadas Payahari later became the initiation guru of Queen Balabai, consort to King Prithviraj of Amer. Agradas was a disciple of Krishnadas Payahari. His Lord Ram is both ‘Rasikbihari’ (one who dwells in emotions) and ‘Kanakbihari (one who dwells in golden environs).

Also, he is the son of Dashrath, friend of the poor, one who dispels the severe pangs of the material world, whose eyes are like new lotus petals, whose face has a lotus-like bloom, whose hands and feet are as carmine as the lotus, whose charms are greater than innumerable cupids, and whose presence is as beautiful as light blue clouds. Images that liken him to the sun, or portray him as the uprooter of demon dynasties come later.

That is why Lord Ram is sometimes seated in a bungalow of flowers and sometimes seen enjoying a ride on a merry-go-round. Notably, the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust overseeing the construction of the  Ram temple in  Ayodhya on the orders of the Supreme Court earned general appreciation when it decided to adopt the rituals of the Ramanandi sect for the consecration and worship of Ram Lalla.

That’s because the Ramanandi sect is known for its pluralism, practising as it does the doctrine of not differentiating between devotees on the basis of caste or creed. No questions are asked, because the one who thinks of God is a man of God. Ergo, there is no discrimination in front of Lord Ram! Recently, however, the Ramanandi sect is believed to have said that the Trust had announced the adoption of its mode of worship only to increase acceptability; since then it has become mangled.

Socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia had indicated in his essay, Ram, Krishna Aur Shiva that  Ayodhya did not give as much importance to Ram’s heroic victory as it did to the fact that even after conquering Lanka, he did not seize it. Instead, he handed over the kingdom to Vibhishan, choosing to remain the representative of liberal and sublime human values.

Why would one who had abandoned his father’s kingdom as if he were a passerby have any greed for the kingdom of Lanka? The values established by him are the ones visible in the traditional images of Shri Ram Panchayatan in  Ayodhya, where he is seen in reassuring posture with Queen Sita and his three brothers.

But the only image the VHP always pushed forward is that of the fierce archer. The purpose behind this needs no telling. Just as there is no need to explain why the new representation of lions on the Ashoka Pillar installed on the new Parliament was given such a ferocious appearance. Supporters of the government have not asserted in vain on social media that being lions, they are bound to roar at some point, and may even bite.

Yogendra Yadav was not wrong when he wrote in one of his columns that the lions engraved on the Ashoka Pillar are installed on the Dharma Chakra — that is, the source of their strength is faith. But the lions astride Modi’s Central Vista are mounted on top of the Dharma Chakra, i.e. they themselves are the embodiment of power. The lions of the original symbol and their replicas are comparable to earlier images of Hanuman and his present-day images in wrathful mode.
       The difference between the lions of the original Ashoka Pillar and the lions in its replica may also be equated with the difference between the rule of law and the rule of the bulldozer.

There are reasons to believe that the Sangh Parivar undertook many of these exercises very deliberately, with long-term goals. Given that, why would it bother to take on the burden of understanding that its machinations expose the intention of relegating or concealing that aspect of Lord Ram’s persona which made Mahatma Gandhi call him “Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram” — the one who purifies even the sinners.

It is no secret that the members of this organisation have been following the path of misinterpreting symbols in order to help their so-called cultural nationalism take root. As far as Lord Ram is concerned, it has been using him as a weapon of power politics.

1557,1557,"In background of their second-place finish in Maharashtra in the recent Lok Sabha elections, the ruling alliance now plans to contest the upcoming assembly elections without a designated chief minister candidate.

These plans are for elections scheduled for September-October this year, as per a report by NDTV.

In the Lok Sabha polls, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Mahayuti alliance secured 17 seats in Maharashtra, while the Opposition alliance won 30. Now, the BJP is aiming to field over 160 candidates for the 288-member legislative assembly.

The alliance will likely avoid projecting a chief ministerial candidate, opting for a collective leadership approach, which is seen as a setback for current Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena leader, Eknath Shinde.

The Maharashtra Assembly elections, with its 288 seats, will see a direct contest between the Mahayuti and the Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance.

The ruling Mahayuti, part of the larger National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition, includes the BJP, the Eknath Shinde faction of the Shiv Sena, and the Ajit Pawar wing of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).

As per the same report, Ajit Pawar's NCP will remain part of the alliance, dispelling rumours about his future.

The Maha Vikas Aghadi, under the INDI Alliance umbrella, comprises the Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT), and the NCP (Sharad Pawar).

This marks only the second time elections are being held in Maharashtra's unique political landscape, where the split of two regional parties has resulted in two Shiv Senas and two NCPs with similar but distinct names.

That’s a sign that the creeping dollarization of the economy -- a hedge against bouts of depreciation and persistent inflation -- that started to pick up in 2011 is not losing steam, despite the central bank’s efforts to anchor the currency., The monetary authority raised rates aggressively in September to stem a run on the lira, sparking a remarkable rebound in the currency -- it has now recouped around a third of its value against the dollar from a record low in August. But with the average rate on short-term deposits paying savers less than one percentage point over inflation, locals have turned their back on the rally., “It’s something that makes me concerned,” said Timothy Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management in London. Low deposit rates, heightened concern over the inflation outlook and skepticism over the “anti-market” measures, such as price controls, that the government has taken is behind the “continued retail bid for dollars.”, While the central bank has been very careful in telegraphing its intent to maintain a tight monetary policy stance until it sees a more “, ” decline inflation, the government has been leaning on lenders, pressuring them to keep a lid on rates before municipal elections in March., Compounded by the lack of demand for credit and a muted competition for deposits between the banks, the average rate on a lira deposit account has dropped by more than 600 basis points from a high in September to 21.1 percent. Headline inflation as of January was running at 20.35 percent., While inflation has cooled from a 15-year high of 25.2 percent in October there’s growing concern that some of the measures the government is taking to tackle the problem are only temporary solutions designed to massage the headline numbers rather than deal with the root cause. That’s adding to the list of reason that Turks are ditching their currency., Over the past few months, authorities have resorted to fining food wholesalers for “exorbitant” price increases, according to Trade Minister Ruhsar Pekcan. The government has set up stations in Turkey’s largest cities to squeeze out middlemen by purchasing vegetables directly from farmers and selling them at cut-rate prices, which is said to be easing pressure on inflation for February., “I’m under the impression that nobody domestically really believes the current state of things is going to last for very long,” said Cristian Maggio, the head of emerging-market research at TD Securities in London. “While there’s no sense of imminence, building an FX buffer at a time of relative quiet in the market may be a better strategy than being forced to act when things are going down the drain.”, ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Center

NEW DELHI: Asserting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often donated his personal savings to public causes, the BJP Tuesday said he has always believed in the principle of ""simple living, high ideals"", as the saffron party slammed the Congress for accusing that he had given ""wrong information"" about a plot he owned in Gandhinagar.
The BJP said the Congress has levelled false allegations regarding Modi's property and counter-accused the Gandhi family of having acquired a lot of assets over years with little-known sources.
The Congress has in the past dismissed the BJP's charge of financial irregularities against the Gandhi family as false and has also termed action by probe agencies as political vendetta.
At a press conference, the Congress alleged on Tuesday Modi had declared in an election affidavit in 2007 that he was the sole owner of Plot 411 in Sector 1 of Gandhinagar, but omitted that information in his election affidavits afterwards and gave details of another piece of land.
""In the light of discrepancies in the affidavit, the Congress party demands that the Election Commission of India takes thorough cognisance of the seemingly deliberate omissions in Modi's affidavit and take appropriate action under the Representation of People Act,"" Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said.
Putting up a strong defence of Modi, the ruling party said his life is an example of believing in ""simple living and high ideals"".
The BJP said Modi recently donated Rs 21 lakh from his personal savings to the welfare fund of sanitary employees during the ' Kumbh Mela '.
In 2014, Modi had donated a similar amount of money from his savings for the education of daughters of Gujarat government employees after he quit as the state's chief minister to take up the prime minister's post, it said.
The BJP said that the prime minister had donated USD 200,000, which he received on being conferred with Seoul Peace Prize , to ""Namami Gange"" project, aimed at cleaning the river.
He had also donated Rs 11.73 crore after auctioning various gifts he had received as prime minister, the BJP said.
Refuting the Congress allegation regarding the Gandhinagar plot, the BJP said four plots purchased by four different persons, including Modi, were amalgamated into one on April 25, 2008 and added that it is obvious that the number of the amalgamated plot is different from the separate individual numbers.
""The caravan of falsehood moves on. There is a bankruptcy of issues in the Congress,"" it said.
A similar charge is made against Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, the BJP noted, saying, ""there is a limit to trivialisation"". Jaitley owned one of the four plots merged later.

706,706," It’s been another dramatic week for China Huarong Asset Management Co., with a drip-feed of news offering investors a range of potential outcomes for the company’s future., Fitch Ratings ,  its credit rating on China Huarong close to junk on Monday, a day after the company said it would ,  a second deadline to report its annual results. The firm ,  a loan given by a state-owned bank to repay an offshore bond maturing Tuesday, according to a Bloomberg News report. While that suggests state support will be extended to China Huarong’s offshore debt, it raises questions over whether the company is short of cash., With $6.5 billion worth of bonds maturing over the rest of this year, there’s a lot at stake in a successful resolution to China Huarong’s challenges. The company is deeply entwined in the country’s financial system: on Wednesday, the nation’s largest life insurer told investors it was exposed to “non-standard assets” issued by China Huarong, according to Citigroup Inc. analysts., A debt restructuring could force investors to shoulder some of the financial burden, while a default would undermine confidence that the government will back the nation’s state-owned firms in times of stress. On the other hand, an equity injection or full-blown financial bailout would be the best-case scenario for bondholders, but would go against government efforts to make markets ,  badly run firms., So far, only the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission has publicly commented on China Huarong, saying the company is operating normally and has ample liquidity. , Here are some of the potential outcomes analysts are considering:, A ‘bail in,’ rather than a bailout. Even if authorities inject capital into China Huarong, equity and debt holders bear the majority of the costs of restructuring. Either creditors accept a steep ,  or face the possibility of a default., Another example can be seen in the central bank’s rescue of troubled Bank of Jinzhou Co. Chengfang Huida, a fund managed by the central bank, last year bought Bank of Jinzhou assets at a 70% discount. This is “the , ,” the central bank said in its 2020 financial stability report. Separately, the troubled business arm of a top Chinese university may impose haircuts approaching 70% on its unsecured creditors as part of a debt restructuring plan, people familiar with the matter said Wednesday., Bloomberg News earlier reported the government is considering a plan that would see a unit of the People’s Bank of China assume more than 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) of Huarong’s assets. Further details on how the arrangement would work weren’t clear., “How much would Huarong get from selling 100 billion yuan in assets? Based on past experience, not 100 billion yuan,” said Bloomberg economist David Qu., A milder case for offshore bondholders would involve splitting China Huarong International Holdings Ltd. into bad and good entities, with the dollar debt included in the latter. In this scenario, Beijing would spin off the bad entity, protecting the unit that issues or guarantees most of Huarong’s dollar bonds., A clear separation -- with transparency over which assets are transfered to where -- would help restore investor trust in the good entity. China may still need to make an equity injection to shore up the good entity’s balance sheet. These changes wouldn’t necessarily be pain-free for bondholders, though the costs would be lower than the most bearish scenario., Bloomberg News ,  last week that Huarong International is in the process of transferring distressed assets worth tens of billions of yuan into a separate offshore entity called China Huarong Overseas Investment Holding Co., A full and speedy bailout without a ,  imposed on investors. There’s no restructuring of the debt; the firm releases its 2020 earnings. The central bank assumes full responsibility for the firm’s finances and authorities clearly state their support for the company., China Huarong commits publicly to honor the keepwell provisions on nearly $22 billion of its dollar bonds. All the overseas units repay the $3.7 billion of outstanding offshore notes due this year in a timely manner., Improved investor confidence and a recovery in the firm’s dollar bond prices allow China Huarong’s international units to raise funds at an affordable cost in the offshore market, easing concern about refinancing., ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center
29,29,"Launching an unsparing attack against the Congress party and the Gandhis over their SPG protection rhetoric, Union Home Minister Amit Shah while speaking on the issue of the passage of the Special Protection Group (Amendment) Bill 2019 said that the security cover of the Gandhi family has been replaced and not revoked as insinuated by many of its leaders.“An effort is being made to tarnish the central government by painting a picture that the government is apathetic towards the security concerns of the Gandhi family and that their protection has been withdrawn. However, far from reducing their security, we have increased their security cover, based on the threat assessment by the security agencies,” Shah said.

Ever since the government of India had downgraded the security cover of the Gandhi family members- Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, the Congress leaders have launched an offensive against the central government, accusing it of perpetuating vendetta politics. Manish Tewari today questioned in the Lok Sabha the centre’s decision to remove the SPG cover of the Gandhis and other prominent Congress leaders such as former PM Manmohan Singh despite intelligence inputs in June suggesting threat assessment has increased.

Read: Here are the possible reasons why Rahul, Sonia and Priyanka Gandhi lost their SPG cover

Responding on the allegations of vendetta politics, Amit Shah contended that it is not in the ethos of the BJP to embrace a vindictive approach in the politics. The vindictive approach is the hallmark of the Congress party, he said.

Taking a swipe at the Congress leaders, Amit Shah insinuated that the protesting Congress leaders are worried about a family and not for the VIPs. Amit Shah asserted that when former PM Manmohan Singh’s SPG security cover was diluted, no one protested but after the dilution of Gandhis security cover, suddenly they have started creating a ruckus. “Why are their differing yardstick to display concern for the security of former PM MMS and the Gandhi family?” Shah questioned.Shah held the Congress party in the dock for bringing several amendments in the SPG Bill with the stated aim of favouring the Gandhi family. Shah claimed that the amendment bill placed by the government is the first time that the security of the Prime Minister is kept in mind.Defending the government’s stance on the SPG (Amendment) Bill 2019, Shah reasoned that his government is committed to providing security to every political party and is already providing the same. However, he added that political parties can’t be provided security equal to that of the Prime Minister of the country.

Amit Shah also listed down the number of instances when the SPG cover was flouted by the Gandhi family. He claimed that on more than 600 occasions, member of Gandhi family went on a trip without taking their SPG cover. Rahul Gandhi, according to Shah, violated SPG norms about 1892 times while travelling in India and about 247 times on his foreign tours since 2015. Essentially, Amit Shah asked the Gandhis why they were so secretive about their trips.

The SPG amendment bill was tabled in the parliament days after the government decided to withdraw the SPG security of the Gandhi family and replaced it with the ‘Z-plus’ security cover by the CRPF.",Right
1610,1610,"In a significant move, Rahul Gandhi has accepted the Congress Working Committee’s decision to become the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. This decision was made public on Tuesday, just hours before the commencement of the 18th Lok Sabha. This marks a crucial moment in Indian politics as the opposition, led by Congress, prepares to challenge the ruling BJP-led NDA coalition.

First Major Battle: Speaker Election
The first significant confrontation between the opposition and the NDA is set for the Speaker’s election. Traditionally, the Deputy Speaker position is given to an opposition member. However, lacking assurance on this tradition, Congress and the INDIA bloc have decided to contest the Speaker’s post. They have nominated K Suresh against the BJP’s candidate, Om Birla, who held the position in the previous Lok Sabha.Symbolic Yet Significant Contest
Although the election for the Speaker’s post might be largely symbolic, given the NDA’s simple majority with 293 MPs and additional support from the YSR Congress, it sends a strong message. The opposition aims to signal a shift in parliamentary dynamics compared to 2014 and 2019.

Empowering the Opposition
Appointing Rahul Gandhi, a prominent figure in Congress, as the Leader of the Opposition is a strategic move. This is the first time since 2014 that an opposition party has met the 54-seat threshold required to claim the post. This position, which comes with cabinet rank, will allow Gandhi to effectively raise issues on behalf of the opposition and the INDIA bloc. These issues include the alleged leaks in various examinations, such as NEET-UG, and the controversial Agnipath scheme for Army recruitment.

Role of the Leader of the Opposition
As the Leader of the Opposition, Rahul Gandhi will join key panels alongside the Prime Minister, such as those selecting Election Commissioners and the CBI director. This constitutional role also grants him the opportunity to engage with visiting heads of state, offering his perspective on national matters.

Announcement of the Decision
The INDIA bloc’s floor leaders finalized the decision to appoint Rahul Gandhi during a meeting at Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge’s residence. KC Venugopal, a senior party leader, announced that Sonia Gandhi, the Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson, had written to Pro-Tem Speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab, informing him of Rahul Gandhi’s appointment.

Congress Working Committee Resolution
The Congress Working Committee had resolved on June 8, shortly after the Lok Sabha election results, to appoint Rahul Gandhi as the Leader of the Opposition. The resolution praised his contributions to the party’s campaign, particularly through the Bharat Jodo Yatra and Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, which many saw as pivotal in reviving the party’s fortunes.

Reluctance and Acceptance
Although initially hesitant, Rahul Gandhi eventually accepted the role, encouraged by his mother Sonia Gandhi and sister Priyanka Gandhi. Congress President Kharge humorously warned him of disciplinary action if he did not comply with the Committee’s decision.

First Constitutional Role
This will be Rahul Gandhi’s first official constitutional role, despite his long tenure in Parliament since 2004. During the UPA rule from 2004 to 2014, party leaders urged him to take a Cabinet position, but he declined. Gandhi’s public image has evolved significantly, particularly following his extensive Bharat Jodo Yatra, which played a crucial role in boosting the Congress’s seat tally in the latest elections.

Impact on Congress and the Opposition
Rahul Gandhi’s appointment as the Leader of the Opposition will strengthen Congress’s position and the broader opposition alliance. The INDIA bloc, which includes major parties like the Samajwadi Party, Trinamool Congress, and DMK, aims to challenge the BJP’s dominance in the Lok Sabha.

This strategic positioning underscores the opposition’s intent to actively participate and influence parliamentary proceedings, reflecting a more robust and dynamic political landscape in India.",Left
1369,1369,"Everyone knows the 'hawa' has turned, but...
Kumar Ketkar uses political intuition to read between the lines of psephological predictions                    Can you even imagine a humiliating setback for Modi–Shah’s BJP in this election? How could anyone, in the face of a propaganda blitzkrieg of such scale and range? Even their detractors and diehard sceptics struggle to envisage an outcome where they are out of power.

There are, however, enough indications that Modi’s carefully crafted image has developed cracks. The latest burst of interviews— including one in which he claims divine origin—is one such indication. But even if Modi and his minions manage to rig these elections and subvert the popular mandate, his messianic reputation will suffer.

M.G. Devasahayam, a former bureaucrat with three decades of experience in senior positions including in the Election Commission, does not see Modi’s BJP getting more than 170 seats. Having witnessed the recent shenanigans of the Election Commission of India (ECI), he has begun a movement to stop the ‘illegal and unconstitutional’ conduct of the ECI, often abetted, in his view, by the indifference (or complicity) of the judiciary.


Devasahayam has lodged cases against the ‘nefarious’ actions of the ECI and mobilised over a hundred former senior IAS officers to fight against the ‘fraud being [perpetrated] to topple democracy and marginalise the Constitution’.

He is convinced the national mood is anti-Modi—and that both the prime minister and his alter ego, home minister Amit Shah, know it. The most significant signals are coming from the BJP’s own ranks. Leaders say in hush-hush tones that the PM and the PMO have reduced them to errand boys.

Retired ministers confide that ministerial meetings are short: A4 sheets are handed out to be read in Parliament or to the media. There is neither appreciation for work done, nor any room to act independently, even in their respective constituencies. They are convinced the party will suffer in this election. Most opinion polls and exit polls do not reflect this sentiment, maybe because their samples are too small or because the surveys are dictated or doctored.

How, then, does one identify a declining trend? By unconventional means like conversations with common folk, through observations that do not take the shape of statistical data on Excel sheets, by using political instinct honed over years of watching elections.


Subaltern waves rarely manifest on the surface. The so-called Indira wave in 1971, the Janata–JP wave in 1977, the sympathy wave after Mrs Gandhi’s assassination in 1984 were exceptions.

***

Let us also not forget that splurging crores on opinion polls does not lead to failsafe predictions. Even the so-called ‘correct predictions’ are largely accidental. What you glean from unhurried conversations with local journalists, ground-level activists, anganwadi workers, third- and fourth-grade government and semi-government employees, factory workers, the not-so-well-off peasantry, armed services personnel, the police beat constable and suchlike are far more revealing.

A sizeable number of junior and senior government employees are fed up. Their ‘inside stories’ rarely make it to print or television. The taxi drivers, autowalas and corner shop paanwalas most journalists project as the voice of the people are not the only ‘common people’.

Politically sensitive noses are able to pick up a ‘hawa’, straws in the wind that indicate which way it is blowing. There is no certified scientific method for this; it is what one gleans from incidental details.


From observing the crowds at election rallies, big and small; making mental notes of how they reached the venue—were they bussed in, did they come on their own; how they responded to the various speakers; how many left mid-way; what kind of discussions did they have after, as they walked home, caught local trains, jumped into metros, hotly arguing with each other—all this and more.

It is this intangible hawa that the Intelligence Bureau, the media and the political parties try to decipher.

***

How big a role does money play in swinging our elections? In a recent article in the Times of India, author and investment analyst Ruchir Sharma writes: ‘[…] candidates are spending $15 million (or Rs 125 crore) in each constituency, which implies a total spending of more than $1 billion (approx. Rs 8,300 crore) to win seats in the more prosperous southern states.’                 I have seen families of five being handed Rs 25,000 in the last two days before voting. (Usually, 36 hours after the campaign is over.) I have seen envelopes with Rs 2,000 notes being distributed in slum areas, along with a sandwich. In middle-class housing societies, with 1- and 2-BHK tenants, candidates and political parties have been spending several lakhs with the consent of RWAs (resident welfare associations), painting buildings or providing cable TV connections.


The whole business of bribing voters, distributing money or favours is not even clandestine. It is talked about openly by loudmouth party karyakartas, volunteers and ‘grateful’ residents.

***

In elections before 1984–85, the karyakarta tended to be a party loyalist or a supporter of a particular candidate; they were neighbourhood social workers or ideology-driven individuals. Not only communists and socialists, but also the then Jana Sangh, Shiv Sena and RSS volunteers worked tirelessly in election campaigns.

Today, there are karyakarta teams available on hire—at a hefty price. There was a time when ‘allurements’ to party activists took the modest shape of a free lunch or dinner, a vehicle pickup and drop. In the 1967, 1971 and 1977 election campaigns, even these ‘facilities’ were missing.

I’ve seen dedicated communist, Congress and RSS volunteers spend their own money, take leave from their factories and offices and work for their chosen candidates. Can we imagine that kind of campaign today? I don’t want to paint an apocalyptic picture. There are still enough earnest volunteers and sincere voters and leaders. It is this kind, the ones who can’t be bought, that worry the BJP. And hence its reliance on money and muscle.

Aware that a victory in these elections is not theirs for the asking, BJP strategists have ensured the party has no dearth of resources to do whatever necessary to retain its hold on power.

While parties like the YSR Congress and Telugu Desam in Andhra, DMK and AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, Trinamool Congress in Bengal and the BRS in Telangana have also learnt the rules of the game, the BJP has bested them all—not simply by growing its own coffers by all means possible (electoral bonds and more such) but also by doing its best to choke the Opposition.

Take for instance the freezing of the bank accounts of the Congress, its principal opposition party, on the eve of elections.

***

To return to the various poll predictions for a moment, anyone who still thinks that the BJP in on its way to win 370 seats on its own, taking the NDA ‘400 paar’, is either smoking potent weed or is in a position to rig these elections at scale.

The latter scenario is scary but improbable, and the key players in that denouement would be the Election Commission of India and their new masters. Among psephologists and political observers of note, Prashant Kishor has given the BJP more than 300 seats while Yogendra Yadav, last heard, said the party will end up with around 230 seats.

Psephology is tricky business. Prashant Kishor seems to know (wonder how?) that the people are disappointed with Modi but not angry. Is this election perhaps a referendum on Modi? Hold your horses till Judgement Day.",Left
665,665," President Joe Biden’s administration on Wednesday unveiled a $1.8 trillion, 10-year plan to ramp up federal support for American families, with a major expansion in spending on child care, paid leave and education., The “American Families Plan,” which Biden will tout in a joint address to Congress Wednesday night, is funded in part by $1.5 trillion of tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans. The proposals still face major changes in Congress, with Republicans set against higher taxes and Democrats having their own priorities., Ambitious as it is, Biden’s program omits some of his campaign-trail agenda items and lacks any move to address a cap on state and local tax deductions that Democrats from high-tax states want removed. Following are key elements to the plan:, Biden is calling to raise the top personal income tax rate to 39.6% for those among the highest 1% of earners. “No one making $400,000 per year or less will see their taxes go up,” the White House said in a fact sheet on the plan. Still, the document didn’t specify whether that threshold applies to both single earners as well as married couples., Biden would increase the capital gains rate to 39.6% from 20% for those earning $1 million or more -- 0.3% of taxpayers or roughly half a million households -- equalizing that rate with the top marginal income tax rate. A 3.8% Obamacare tax on investment would then be added on top, meaning the richest would pay a 43.4% federal rate on realized investment returns. State taxes could put the combined tax bill north of 50%., The plan would also end a long-standing capital gains tax break on inheritances known as “step-up in basis,” which allows heirs to use the market value of assets at the time of inheritance rather than the actual purchase price as the cost basis for capital gains when the holdings are sold., The proposal exempts the first $1 million of gains from the end of stepped-up basis, while there’s no tax if the gains are used for charitable donations. There will also be “protections so that family-owned businesses and farms will not have to pay taxes when given to heirs who continue to run the business.”, The carried interest tax break used by private equity and hedge fund managers to lower their tax bills would be eliminated under Biden’s plan. In what critics call a loophole, that allowed for a share of income being classed as a capital gain, with an associated lower tax rate., The administration also would eliminate a real estate tax break for when property investors sell one holding for a more expensive one., The plan calls for increased audits on high-earners that could collect an additional $700 billion in tax revenue, with funding increases for the Internal Revenue Service. Biden is also proposing to require banks to report information on account flows, so that earnings from investments and business profits are reported to the IRS like wages are., Biden is proposing to extend through 2025 an enhanced version of the child tax credit. The credit, increased for 2021 in the March pandemic-relief package, provides a $3,600 credit for children under six and $3,000 for those six and older. The IRS is slated to send the payments regularly, which amounts to $250 or $300 per child per month, depending on their age. Congressional Democrats are pushing Biden to make this change permanent., The plan includes $225 billion to help low-income families pay for child care, provide funding to child care providers and boost wages for child care workers to $15 an hour. Biden is also proposing to make permanent a tax credit for child care costs that would reimburse families for care of children 12 and under with a credit worth ,  $4,000 for one child or $8,000 for multiple children., Biden would create a $225 billion national paid family and medical leave program. It would provide partial wage replacement for workers who take time off to care for a newborn or an ill family member, recover from a health issue, deal with a family member’s military deployment, address domestic violence issues or deal with the death of a loved one. The plan guarantees 12 weeks of paid parental, family, and personal leave by year 10 of the program. It provides workers with two-thirds of average wage replacement per month, ,  $4,000. Lowest-wage workers will get pay replaced at 80%., The plan would pump $200 billion into an expansion of tax credits for households that buy health insurance on their own, saving families an average of $50 per person per month. Biden’s outline said nine million people would save hundreds of dollars per year on their premiums, and four million uninsured people will gain coverage., An expansion of the earned-income tax credit for childless workers who earn wages below the poverty line would be made permanent under Biden’s proposal. The expansion roughly triples the value of the benefit for those individuals, the fact sheet said., The plan includes $200 billion for free universal pre-school for all three- and four-year-olds. Pre-kindergarten teachers will earn at least $15 per hour, and those with academic qualifications will receive pay comparable to that of kindergarten teachers., The plan would provide $109 billion to cover two years of tuition-free community college for students and an $85 billion investment in Pell Grants, to aid students pursuing ,  a four-year degree. The plan also includes $62 billion to improve college retention rates for disadvantaged students and pump $46 billion into historically black universities, tribal colleges and other institutions that serve minorities., There is $45 billion to improve the health of school meal programs and provide food for K-12 students during summer breaks in Biden’s proposal., The proposal earmarks $2 billion to modernize the unemployment insurance system, which has been subjected to fraud and technical challenges during the spike in unemployment caused by the pandemic. Biden didn’t call for an automatic extension of jobless benefits as some Democrats had requested, but he pledged to work with Congress automatically extend benefits based on economic conditions., The plan did not include any references to expanding the $10,000 state and local tax, or SALT, deduction. More than 20 House Democrats have said that tax break must be boosted to support Biden’s economic agenda. The proposal also didn’t include an expansion of the estate tax -- a long-standing Democratic priority that Biden campaigned on. Nor was there an enlargement of Medicare or the drug-price reduction measures that many congressional Democrats have pushed for -- though Biden’s outline said both issues were priorities for him., ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Left

Biden only last week hosted a foreign leader -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga -- for the first time at the White House, and the U.S. held this week’s global climate summit virtually., Last year’s Group of Seven meeting was scheduled to be hosted by former President Donald Trump at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland, but was ultimately scrapped when other nations expressed reservations about in-person travel., Biden will be the second consecutive president to forgo the modern presidential tradition of making Canada the first foreign visit. Trump instead traveled to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Italy, the Vatican and Belgium for his first trip abroad. But Biden hosted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for his first virtual summit, and spoke with the Canadian leader about vaccine supply earlier this week., The G-7 talks will focus on “public health, economic recovery, and climate change, and demonstrate solidarity and shared values among major democracies,” and Biden will hold bilateral meetings with other leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Psaki said. In Brussels, Biden will also participate in a U.S.–EU Summit to discuss health, economic, climate change, and foreign policy concerns., The White House indicated that additional stops could be added to Biden’s inaugural trip.

1056,1056,"In the afternoon of 16 June, Parmeshwar Kumar Keshari’s family rushed him to the district hospital in Ballia, Uttar Pradesh. Parmeshwar, who was in his early seventies, had suddenly started vomiting, followed by diarrhoea, high fever and body aches. Shravan Kumar Keshari, one of his sons, told me that Parmeshwar was “fit and had no ailments. That day, he followed his usual routine, had a proper breakfast, but in the afternoon, he fell really sick.” By 10.45 pm, Parmeshwar was dead. Shravan said that a doctor doing the rounds at the hospital told the family that Parmeshwar “died due to a heat stroke.” Ballia district had recorded a high of 43 degrees Celsius that day, and temperatures had been consistently over forty degrees since the first week of June.

As I spoke to the family at their house, in the village of Rudrapur Gaighat, Dinesh Kumar Keshari, the eldest son, described the harrowing conditions at the hospital that day. “There was no stretcher and no bed available, so we had to place my father on the floor. The doctors treated him there initially.” He added that they “somehow managed to get a bed after waiting for two hours, when another patient died. There was no AC and no cooler in the emergency ward that day.” Dinesh said that there were a few fans, but not a single one was working properly. “There was utter chaos in the hospital, and it was extremely hot in there.” Shravan said that there were scores of patients in the hospital exhibiting the same symptoms as their father.

The hospital’s chief medical superintendent, Dr Divakar Singh, told local journalists that around twenty-five people had died that day of diseases caused by the heat wave and that sixty percent of the patients at the hospital had been suffering from heatstroke. Local media reports vary wildly on the number of deaths between 15 and 16 June—between thirty-four and fifty-four. The very next day, the health minister, Brijesh Pathak, transferred Divakar to Azamgarh, and the denials began. The government rejected Divakar’s claim of deaths caused by the heat wave. According to a report published by Hindustan on 20 June, the hospital had recorded 97 deaths in June 2022, while there had already been 154 deaths till 18 June this year, out of which 100 deaths occurred between 11 June and 18 June alone. Another report in the same newspaper, on 23 June, noted that 160 deaths were recorded at the hospital between 13 June to 23 June.

Immediately after Divakar’s transfer, the district magistrate, Ravindra Kumar, took overall control of the situation. The chief medical officer, Jayant Kumar, became the public face dealing with the crisis; and SK Yadav was appointed as the new CMS. Soon after, the health department appointed a three-member team of experts to investigate the increase in deaths in the district. The team—comprising Dr AK Singh, the director for communicable diseases; Dr KN Tiwari, the director for medical care; and Dr Mohit Sharma, the joint director for communicable diseases—reached Ballia on 18 June.

96,96,"Dravidian parties are not against Hindi, they are against Tamil                          The entire foundation of the negativity-driven Dravidian movement started by the rabid Hindu hater Perriyar is based on hatred for Hindi, Sanskrit, Vedas and anything that was related to Sanatan Dharm. Since its foundation, hatred against Hindi language and Hindu religion has been the first, last and the only resort or line of defence for Dravidian politicians. To curb and fend off any brewing criticism, opposition and their failure they rekindle the needless bogey of Hindi Imposition.
Now it seems that with the reformist politics started by PM Narendra Modi, this divisive politics has entered into its last phase. Henceforth, the dravidian parties have now come out open to infuse everything they have at their command to keep the facade of Hindi Imposition alive and continue enjoying the fruits of politics of hatred, linguistic and regional chauvinism.
The bogey of Hindi Imposition claims life of an innocent
The recently concluded Kashi-Tamil Sangam in Varanasi has set the ball rolling. It has started to adversely affect the divisive politics of linguistic and regional chauvinism repeatedly touted by the Dravidian parties.

With their back to the wall, the Dravidian parties are playing with the life of innocent and misinformed individuals to cruelly drag the bogey of Hindi Imposition and so-called trampling of Dravidian languages including Tamil.

Unfortunately, in the negative campaign to reignite the farce and fade the strong buzz for the unifying cultural event, misguided DMK workers have started to adopt reprehensible tactics of blackmail politics and not putting great value to one’s life and trust in the systems of democracy.

Evidently, falling prey to this negative campaign of Hindi imposition, an 85-year-old DMK worker Thangavel committed suicide by immolating himself. Reportedly, he wrote a suicide letter accusing the Central government of forcefully imposing Hindi.

In his letter, he wrote, “there is no need for imposing Hindi when the Tamil language is here.”

By using the unfortunate and condemnable incident, the DMK party desperately tried to safeguard its vested political interests.

Sangam the Way forward to end politics of Dravidian Parties
In the absence of credible and rational politics, the Dravidian parties wrote their success by infusing hatred against Hindi and the style of doing politics in the North. With this, they successfully shared power among themselves without offering anything in the name of development politics.

But now, with the advent of social media, credible opposition gaining public support and the relentless push towards unifying politics by the Modi government, voters have started to see through the facade of Hindi Imposition and so-called trampling of Dravidian languages.

Also Read: PM Modi has announced the beginning of the end of the sickening Dravidian politic

With the month-long Sangam (confluence) of Kashi and Tamil cultures, PM Narendra Modi put his political weight behind the promotion of Tamil in other states including the most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. He also stressed that every citizen should cherish Indic languages including Tamil. Further, he added that efforts should be made to preserve our languages and it is the duty of every citizen to break language and other barriers.

Apart from other inclusive steps and reformist policies by the Modi government, the Kashi-Tamil Sangam has been the single largest act that has thoroughly exposed the shallowness of the arguments (cacophony) repeated round the clock by the Dravidian parties. Contrary to the portrayal by these Dravidian parties, PM Modi eloquently spoke in favour of promoting Tamil and that too while being in the ‘Hindi belt’.

Seeing the momentum gaining in support of the Kashi-Tamil Sangam and credible voices demanding more such events in future to iron out the misconceptions, the so-called conflict of North-South or the mistaken belief of hatred for each other, the Dravidian parties have pulled out its usual rhetoric of Hindi Imposition and step-fatherly treatment by the Central government and is ready to use the unfortunate death of its misguided worker who took unfortunate step by falling prey to the facade of Hindi imposition.

It is to be said that Dravidian Politicians are a rare breed of individuals who end up cheating the communities they claim to represent. Rather than lending their support to unifying events like Kashi-Tamil Sangam and promoting Tamil, the Dravidian parties are resorting to hollow, rhetorical and destructive politics. By making anti-Hindi statements or acts and rhetorical statements on Tamil, the Dravidian parties have exposed that they are in only for virtual signalling and have done nothing substantiate to promote the rich culture and heritage of Tamil.

1044,1044,"AT THE LAUNCH OF HIS LATEST BOOK, Sakina’s Kiss, Vivek Shanbhag said that masculinity “is like water. A hairline crack is enough for it to seep in and be all over the place.” It is true that it would have been a lost battle to try and single out the parts of the novel—translated from Kannada by Srinath Perur—that address masculinity in isolation from the rest of its themes, the concept being too slippery and omnipresent to isolate without being contrived. The narrative, which revolves around a middle-class married couple, Viji and Venkataramana, begins with people repeatedly showing up to their Bengaluru apartment and inquiring, suspiciously, about their daughter, Rekha, who is out of town. Venkataramana, the first-person narrator, is livid at their appearance.

I cannot stand such groups of boys. They roam around aimlessly instead of studying and waste their parents’ money. They have no respect for elders or for rules and are a menace to society. The sight of them always sets off a small fury within me: the defiant way they carry themselves, those T-shirts and pointy hairstyles, their apathetic expressions. But when I try and put a finger on why I should feel that way, I cannot come up with a definite reason and it leaves me flustered.

Despite Viji’s reaction being calmer, Venkataramana decides that, although he is content to defer to his wife and daughter on most things with no bearing on “the real world,” in this instance, “as the man of the house, it was my duty to step forward and take care of it.” This declaration, on which the first chapter ends, sets the tone for what follows—ominous, because these visitors signal trouble on the horizon, but also contradictory, because the more the novel ventures into the narrator’s inner world, his insecurities and habits, the more the notion of his unshakeable authority is unravelled.

Reading Sakina’s Kiss as well as other writing published over the last five years illuminates how recent fiction has introspected on the ways in which generation gaps, globalisation, changing social mores and political shifts, gender norms and roles, caste and class all contribute to the shaping of masculinity and family dynamics. Half the Night is Gone by Amitabha Bagchi is a treatise on brotherhood and estrangement. Anubha Yadav’s The Anger of Saintly Men, the story of three brothers growing up in north India in the 1990s, explores how young boys are moulded into men in the Indian household. Aruni Kashyap’s short story “His Father’s Disease” revolves around a mother’s despair at her son’s queerness, which she sees as being a legacy of her husband. My Father’s Garden by Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, a triptych of novellas, follows a young doctor as he “negotiates love and sexuality, his need for companionship, and the burdens of familial expectation.” Fern Road Boy by Angshu Dasgupta follows the coming-of-age journey of a young boy who struggles to replicate the ways of masculinity around him.

He asserted that Avimukteshwaranand, who calls himself the Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth in Uttarakhand, receives full support from Congress.                                        Evidence of Congress Support
Govindanand presented a letter from Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. In this letter, dated 13 September 2022, Vadra refers to Avimukteshwaranand as a respected Shankaracharya. This raised questions, as the Supreme Court has put a stay on this title.                                      Congress Influence on Religious Matters
Govindanand criticized the Congress party’s involvement in religious affairs. He questioned whether Congress should have the power to decide who becomes a Shankaracharya. He suggested that Avimukteshwaranand is using Vadra’s letter in court to strengthen his claim to the Shankaracharya position.

Political Motivations Behind Congress Support
The allegations hint at political motives behind Congress’s backing of Avimukteshwaranand. Govindanand claimed that Vadra supports him because of his opposition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He described Avimukteshwaranand as a “toy” in the Congress party’s political game.

Avimukteshwaranand’s Alleged Anti-Hindu Stance
Govindanand pointed out that Avimukteshwaranand often sides with Congress MP Rahul Gandhi when he makes controversial remarks about Hinduism. This alignment with Congress further fuels suspicions about his political connections.

Demand for Accountability
Govindanand called for action against Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. He demanded that she either publicly apologize for writing the letter or face potential contempt charges in the Supreme Court.

Questioning Avimukteshwaranand’s Legitimacy
Govindanand strongly contested Avimukteshwaranand’s claims to religious titles. He labeled him as “fake no. 1” and argued that even calling him a sadhu, sant, or sanyasi is incorrect.

Allegations of Misconduct
Serious accusations were leveled against Avimukteshwaranand. These included claims of involvement in killings and kidnappings, challenging the Pran Pratishtha of Lord Ram, and misrepresenting himself at weddings.

Doubts About Avimukteshwaranand’s Knowledge
Govindanand questioned Avimukteshwaranand’s understanding of religious matters. He cited an instance where Avimukteshwaranand allegedly confused gold with brass when discussing temple treasures.

Legal Troubles
The allegations against Avimukteshwaranand extend to legal issues. Govindanand mentioned a non-bailable arrest warrant against him, adding weight to the accusations.

This controversy highlights the complex interplay between politics and religion in India. The Congress party’s alleged involvement in religious matters raises questions about the separation of religion and state. As the dispute unfolds, it may have significant implications for both religious institutions and political dynamics in the country.         ",Right
839,839,"After months of speculations that he might join the Congress, Patidar leader and head of Shree Khodaldham Trust Naresh Patel on Thursday announced that he is postponing his decision to join politics. The announcement comes as a major setback for the opposition Congress that was in talks with him.

After a meeting with the members of various Trusts that he is associated with, Patel announced in Rajkot that he was postponing his decision to join politics. Fifty-six-year-old Patel, an industrialist and social worker, however, kept a window open when he said that in future times and circumstances may make you do anything.

Patel said that he has taken a decision based on the survey he had initiated of just not the Patidar community but other strata of the society. According to him, 80 per cent youth and 50 per cent women wanted him to join politics, but elders did not want him to join politics.

Gujarat BJP president C.R. Paatil was quick to react. When asked to comment at a function, Paatil said that Patel’s decision is mature and welcomed.

Justifying his decision, Patel said that if he joined one party then he would not be able to work for all sections of the society and then would get bound by the party.

While it is a major setback for the Congress, it is surely a positive sign for the ruling BJP for coming from the Leuva subcaste of the Patidar community, he has a major hold over them, especially in Saurashtra region. About a month ago, Patidar leader Hardik Patel had quit the Congress. He later on joined the BJP.

In 2017, following the Patidar Reservation Stir headed by Hardik in 2015, the BJP had suffered a brunt as Patels, who are normally believed to be voting for the BJP, voted for the Congress in large numbers.

The Patidars hold a major sway over 50 out of the 182 assembly seats in Gujarat and Levua and Kadva together constitute about 15 per cent of the state’s electorate.

Sources said that Patel’s joining the Congress had become doubtful after his friend election strategist Prashant Kishore did not join the Congress. Patel has leanings towards the Congress.

He said that he would support any good candidate contesting from any party.

Patel is believed to have met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi also. He along with Kishore also had a meeting with Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Ghelot.

The grapevine has it that he had proposed that he be made a chief ministerial candidate face to which the Congress disagreed.

Replying to a question as to whether his decision of not joining politics comes after the Congress rejected the condition, Patel said it is up to the party to accept or not to accept. He, however, did not say that a condition was laid for joining the Congress.

Whether Patel is joining politics or not had been going on for over three months now and the way he was delaying the decision, it was becoming clear that he is unlikely to join the Congress.

The possibility of the BJP having prevailed is also not being ruled out.

Yet for the current quarter, Insee forecasts the growth rate will decelerate to around 0.25% after the government implemented a strict lockdown in April that will lift only gradually in May and June., At around 4% below pre-crisis levels, the loss of activity is as much as it was during the worst moment of the global financial crisis, Insee’s chief economist Julien Pouget said., Still, the economy is holding up better than during the first two nationwide lockdowns in April and October of last year, and vast government support for workers and households has preserved productive capacity, Insee said., “The economy can rebound quickly, if and only if the pandemic is kept in check,” Pouget said. “We are both so far and so near to recovery,”, Bloomberg Economics predicts the currency bloc as a whole will see output grow around 1.6% this quarter, with Germany expanding 2.7% and Italy 1%., ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center
507,507," , In late March, Argentine President Alberto Fernandez sent his guy to Washington to smooth things over. With negotiations stalled, Economy Minister Martin Guzman had meetings with U.S. officials and the International Monetary Fund over its $45 billion loan., Back home, Fernandez’s populist vice president took to the microphone to make one thing clear., “We can’t pay because we don’t have the money,” said Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who held the nation’s top job from 2007 to 2015. The IMF’s terms are “unacceptable.”, It was a telling moment. When Fernandez, 62, took office in the final days of 2019, he presented himself as pragmatic. True, he’d briefly been Kirchner’s chief of staff within the Peronist left but he accepted a role for capitalism and wouldn’t allow Kirchner and her loyalists to set the agenda., Few would argue that he has succeeded., In recent days, Kirchner further asserted her influence by stopping the removal of an ally, a deputy energy minister in charge of key electricity prices., “It’s evident that the president is backing the core Kirchner wing of his coalition,” says Jimena Blanco, director of Latin America research at consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft in Buenos Aires. “That’s going to create more tension and uncertainty.”, Indeed, six months before midterm elections, pragmatism is a distant memory. A strategy that puts political decisions above everything has squashed any plan to boost exports, lower inflation and kick-start growth. Exacerbated by the pandemic and too few vaccines, a rudderless economy is having its revenge., Social unrest, , , packed hospitals, cabinet disputes and a deteriorating business climate loom. Nearly 70% of ICU beds are occupied. About 42% of Argentines live in , , up from 26% in 2017., Economic plight is so common, it’s playground talk. Kids in Buenos Aires know the dollar exchange rate, the level of inflation and what a sovereign default means., That’s because Argentina has defaulted nine times and mostly been run by those hostile to the Washington consensus. That changed briefly in 2015 when Mauricio Macri won. He tried to open the economy but recession unraveled his presidency, bringing back the populists. People expected Fernandez to strike a happy medium. They don’t anymore., It’s been illegal for companies to fire workers for over a year. Businesses face price freezes. Savers can only exchange pesos for $200 a month. If Argentines use their credit card abroad, they pay a 30% “solidarity tax.” The rich are fighting against a new ,  on wealth. Inflation will reach 50% again this year, while consumer confidence is tanking., Pandemic fatigue and finite resources are aggravating poor internal coordination., To be sure, Fernandez inherited Herculean challenges. In 2018, Macri agreed to an IMF deal with unrealistic assumptions and failed to stabilize the economy. He also passed on high inflation, as Kirchner had done to him., Fernandez, who spent years lambasting Kirchner’s leadership and then set aside their differences, won the presidency having never run for governor, mayor or congress., An official close to him says he hopes to get wages to beat inflation but concedes that some of his policies, such as price controls, aren’t ideal., Juntos por el Cambio is his biggest opponent in the vote, which chooses half the seats in the lower house and a third in the senate. Buenos Aires Mayor Horacio Rodriguez Larreta, the top opposition leader, pushed to reopen schools and saw his popularity soar., On Tuesday, Fernandez suffered a heavy political defeat when the Supreme Court ruled that the country’s capital has the autonomy to decide whether its schools can hold in-person classes, rejecting a previous government order that classes be held virtually to contain a second wave of the pandemic., The president lambasted the top court’s ruling, saying he will continue focusing on protecting the population’s health., “They can issue the rulings they want, we will do what we have to do,” he said at an event. , Fernandez may still benefit from surging commodity prices and some stimulus at the IMF. But after ,  $65 billion with private creditors last year, IMF talks have bogged down and no plan has emerged., As a ,  over shots for VIPs erupted, Fernandez’s approval dropped to 36.7% by late April from a peak of 57% almost a year ago, according to Buenos Aires-based pollster Management & Fit., Much of the drop is over the economy. Argentines just endured a three-year recession, where the peso lost 80% of its value and people pulled half of their dollar deposits, leading to capital controls., The economy ,  in February, and a low-quality recovery seems underway: Argentina gained 1.3 million informal jobs in the second half of last year but shed 189,000 formal jobs., Companies, especially multinationals, are increasingly at odds with the government as it talks about another basket of 100 essential goods that would have prices frozen for half the year, according to people with direct knowledge., “Uncertainty turns into distress, distress into frustration, and frustration into little desire to invest,” says Alejandro Diaz, CEO of AmCham Argentina, the lobby for U.S. companies in the country. When companies’ costs rise more than double the price of their products, “the temporary policy becomes structural.”, Amid the new Covid wave, Argentina has debt payments coming due with limited foreign reserves. It owes $2.4 billion to the group of rich countries known as the Paris Club, due this month. By September, it needs to start repaying the IMF., No IMF deal gets a green light without U.S. support. For now, Argentina caught a break from Joe Biden’s administration. A ,  to boost the IMF’s reserves, known as SDRs, may offer breathing room -- some extra cash in its stake at the IMF that it could use to cover two principal payments later this year., “The IMF deal may not only narrow differences between the opposition and ruling party, but also the differences within the coalition itself,” says Emmanuel Alvarez Agis, a former economy vice minister under Kirchner. “Investors see that Argentina took out an IMF debt that isn’t compatible with the size of the economy.

55,55,"In a decision which could have serious law and order implications, the newly elected Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday has reportedly assured senior NCP leadership that criminal cases filed against the Dalit ‘activists’ in connection with the violence at Bhima-Koregaon will be withdrawn at earliest.

According to a Times of India report, the decision to withdraw cases against these ‘activists’ who had allegedly resorted to violence during the Bhima Koregaon event comes after Maharashtra CM had asked the state home department to immediately withdraw criminal cases filed against the so-called ‘activists’ booked for protesting against the cutting of trees in Aarey Colony and those opposing the Nanar refinery in the Konkan.

“Law-enforcing agencies had initiated criminal proceedings against activists for their alleged involvement in the Bhima-Koregaon violence and the Indu Mill agitation. All of them were falsely implicated, so we requested the CM to withdraw the cases immediately, and he acceded to our request,” said NCP MLA Prakash Gajbhiye, who was also present at the meeting.

Two days back, NCP MLA Jitendra Awhad had demanded the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government to drop the charges slapped against Sudhir Dhawale, a prime accused in the Bhima Koregaon case for his involvement in the Elgar Parishad and an alleged ‘Urban Naxal’. NCP leader Dhananjay Munde had also written to Uddhav Thackeray for the same.

On the 200 anniversary of the battle of Bhima-Koregaon on January 1 last year, a large number of people had gathered at the memorial near Pune. While the crowd was dispersing, violence erupted not only in Pune and surrounding areas but across the state. A 28-year-old youth, Rahul Patangale, was killed in the violence. 52 cases were registered and 152 people were arrested for violence and riots in the streets.

The Bhima-Koregaon cases are different from the ones related to the Elgar Parishad rally held the day before the January violence. Cracking down on the Elgar Parishad’s alleged ‘Urban Naxals’ the Maharashtra police and ATS had arrested several alleged Naxal sympathisers and co-conspirators last year.

Apart from the Elgar Parishad cases, the Pune police had registered 58 cases against 152 people for the violence during the Bhima Koregaon event. Subsequently, on February 9, 2018, the state government appointed Justice JN Patel, a former judge of the Bombay high court, to probe all aspects of the violence under the Commission of Inquiry Act.

In connection with the Elgar Parishad case, ten ‘activists’, who are known to be sympathisers of left-wing terror were nabbed by the Pune police. These ‘activists’ are also accused of plotting to kill Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Initially, the five suspected ‘Urban Naxals’ were arrested by the Pune police on 6 June 2018 over charges of organising the Elgaar Parishad held at Pune’s Shaniwarwada on 31 December 2017, which is believed to have instigated the Bhima-Koregaon violence a day later.

They are Delhi based activist Rona Wilson, advocate Surendra Gadling, professor Shoma Sen and Mahesh Raut from Nagpur and Mumbai’s Sudhir Dhawale.

The Pune police had filed a 5,000-page charge sheet, which had names of 10 persons of the above ‘Urban Naxals’. Addition to these five, absconding underground Maoists Milind Teltumbde, Prakash alias Ritupam Goswami, Prashant Bose alias Kishan da, Manglu and Deepu have also been named in the charge sheet.

Apart from these ten alleged ‘Urban Naxals’, in a nation-wide crackdown, the police had arrested P Varavara Rao in Hyderabad, Gautam Navlakha in Delhi, Vernon Gonzalves and Arun Pereira in Mumbai, Sudha Bhardwaj in Delhi, Anand Teltumbde in Goa and Stan Swamy in Ranchi in relation with Elgar Parishad violence and plot to kill the Prime Minister Modi. Gautam Navlakha is accused of having links with Maoists, Kashmiri separatists, Pakistan’s ISI and banned terror organisation Hizbul.

The withdrawal of cases by a newly elected government against the perpetrators involved in riots and vandalism is not new. As soon as Congress came to power in Madhya Pradesh in 2018, the government had withdrawn the Bharat Bandh cases filed in April 2018 against Dalits after alliance partner BSP had threatened to withdraw their support given to Kamal Nath government.

The Kamal Nath government had also decided to withdraw nearly 50,000 similar cases filed in the last 15 years by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during its tenure in Madhya Pradesh.",Right
955,955,"Leader of Opposition (LoP) Rahul Gandhi on Monday claimed that a climate of fear pervades the country, with a group of six individuals trapping the nation in a 'chakravyuh.'Leader of the Opposition (LoP) Rahul Gandhi, on Friday alleged that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is planning a raid against him after his ‘Chakravyuh’ speech in Parliament.

In a post on X, Gandhi mentioned that he was “waiting with open arms.” “Apparently, 2 in 1 didn’t like my Chakravyuh speech. ED ‘insiders’ tell me a raid is being planned,” Gandhi said.
Using the ‘chakravyuh’ metaphor as a central theme, Gandhi claimed on Monday that a climate of fear pervades the country, with a group of six individuals trapping the nation in a ‘chakravyuh.’ He promised that the INDIA bloc would break this ‘chakravyuh.’

While participating in the Lok Sabha debate on the Budget 2024-25, Gandhi asserted that the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) would ensure the passage of a legal guarantee for MSP and a caste census by the House.

Gandhi drew a historical parallel, referencing an event in Haryana’s Kurukshetra thousands of years ago, where six people killed the youth Abhimanyu in a ‘chakravyuh.’ He highlighted that a ‘chakravyuh’ symbolizes violence and fear.

Gandhi referred to the Mahabharat legend, where Abhimanyu was killed in a ‘chakravyuh,’ a multi-layered military formation designed to entrap a warrior with opponents strategically positioned in a lotus-shaped labyrinth. He noted that this ‘chakravyuh’ is also called a ‘padmavyuha’ because it resembles a lotus, which is the BJP’s election symbol.

Jain is the minister for health, power, home, PWD, industries, urban development, flood, irrigation and water in the Arvind Kejriwal-led government.

The ED had in 2018 questioned the AAP MLA from Shakur Basti in connection with the case.

In a statement, the Enforcement Directorate said it has issued a provisional order under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) for the attachment of the assets.

The ""attached immovable properties worth Rs 4.81 crore belong to Akinchan Developers Pvt. Ltd., Indo Metal Impex Pvt Ltd, Paryas Infosolutions Pvt. Ltd., Manglayatan Projects Pvt. Ltd., J.J. Ideal Estate Pvt. Ltd., Swati Jain, wife of Vaibhav Jain, Sushila Jain, wife of Ajit Prasad Jain, and Indu Jain, wife of Sunil Jain.""

The probe found that ""during the period 2015-16, when Satyendar Kumar Jain was a public servant, the companies beneficially owned and controlled by him received accommodation entries to the tune of Rs 4.81 crore from shell companies against cash transferred to Kolkata-based entry operators through the hawala route.""

""These amounts were utilised for direct purchase of land or for repayment of loan taken for the purchase of agricultural land in and around Delhi,"" ED mentioned.

The ED case of money laundering against the AAP minister stems from an August 2017 FIR by the CBI against him and others on charges of alleged possession of disproportionate assets.

Kejriwal in February had said that he has learnt from sources the ED was going to arrest Satyendar Jain just before the Punjab assembly elections and accused the Centre of targeting the Aam Aadmi Party after realising the BJP ""would lose"" the polls.

1437,1437,"Dhruv Rathee, ’eminent’ Youtuber and propagandist for the Aam Aadmi Party, is renowned for his habit of oversimplifying complex issues in order to suit his larger political objectives. Recently, he made a comment on Twitter which perfectly captures his intellectual bankruptcy. Responding to a tweet Dhruv Rathee opined that ‘by default, left-wing thinkers will always be more creative, imaginative and empathetic than their right-wing counterparts. The ’eminent thinker’ also opined that the left-wing promotes ‘globalisation’, ‘open-mindedness’ and ‘out-of-box revolutionary thinking’ while the right-wing promotes ‘tradition’, ‘rules’, ‘strictness’ and ‘conservative thinking’. Thus, Dhruv Rathee is attributing causal relationship between personal traits and political opinions but he is doing so in the wrong direction. From his tweet, it is evident that he believes a person automatically becomes more creative when he endorses left-wing political opinions when, in fact, it is infinitely more likely that a creative person is more likely to have left-wing political opinions under the very specific sociopolitical conditions that exist today. As is his wont, Dhruv Rathee oversimplifies a complicated and an interesting issue in order to turn it into another opportunity to pat his back for having left-wing political opinions. His claim that left-wing promotes globalisation is extremely incorrect and is so wrong that it makes one question his very sanity. ‘Globalisation’ is very much a capitalist agenda that has no support at all from the left because it impacts domestic workers adversely. It is an agenda of the MNCs and MNCs by their very definition are not ‘left-wing’. Does the Left-Wing promote globalisation as Dhruv Rathee claims? The core objectives of ‘Globalisation’ are free trade, greater ease in the movement of goods and resources and more migration. In the United States of America, these are all the main agendas of the Republican Party, or at least it was until Donald Trump put his feet down. The support for illegal immigration from the Left and more globalisation from the Left is not due to ideological commitment but because it serves the interests of the Corporate Donors of the Democrat party by providing them with low wage workers. It is a simple matter of supply and demand. The more the available pool of workers, the lower is the cost of labour. Similarly, MNCs stand to benefit the most from free trade as well. It can be seen how MNCs in the United States have outsourced manufacturing to China where the cost of labour is low so that they can increase their share of the profits. As a consequence of course, workers in the United States have suffered gravely due to it. And these policies had bipartisan consensus across party lines. And it also must be noticed that supporters of Bernie Sanders agree with those of Bernie Sanders when it comes to such economic issues. And that is why a lot of ‘Bernie Bros’ voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 US Presidential Elections instead of Hillary Clinton. Thus, ‘Globalisation’ should not be viewed from the prism of ideology under current circumstances. But objectively speaking, it is closer to right-wing economics than the left. Care should be taken to remember here that the Indian ‘right-wing’ is not very ‘right-wing’ on matters of economics. Furthermore, it should also be borne in mind that Communist parties, with the prominent exception of India, have often been fiercely nationalist. Soviet Russia in the 20th Century was extremely nationalist in its approach, the Communist Party of China is extremely nationalist. It’s only India that communist parties have often tried to undermine the territorial integrity of our country. Thus, considering all things, to claim that left-wing promotes ‘Globalisation’ is foolishness of the highest order. China, which literally has a Communist regime, has dedicated itself to bring an end to Globalisation as we know it. In India, the protectionist measures which are strongly espoused by all parties, and most vigorously by the ‘Left-Wing’, also indicate that Dhruv Rathee was just being an idiot. Will Left-Wingers always be more creative, imaginative and empathetic? Let us be clear, creativity and empathy are core human traits that have existed ever since the dawn of humanity. By contrast, left-wing politics as we know it has its origins in the French Revolution of 1789. If it were left to Rathee, he would argue that the Early Man who used to make paintings in caves was a left-winger. By his account, religious texts and traditions from thousands of years ago which emphasise the importance of acts of compassion and kindness are left-wing too. That is, quite obviously, ridiculous. Therefore, for him to declare that left-wingers will always be more creative and empathetic is simply ridiculous. Also, creativity and empathy are more or less traits that are innate in an individual. These are traits that cannot be acquired. Either a person is creative or he is not, either a person is empathetic or he is not. Either a person scores high on the openness trait or he does not. Contrary to political opinions of an individual which changes frequently during the course of an individual over time, such characteristics of an individual do not usually change. Therefore, to insinuate that left-wingers will magically always be more creative and empathetic and left-wing promotes ‘open-mindedness’ is just bollocks. Humans have been creative for as long as they have existed. The greatest works of Art throughout the course of history have been produced by deeply religious men and women. Such artists have always been patronised by the Kings, Nobles and the Aristocracy. Therefore, the claim that left-wingers will always be more creative than their right-wing counterparts flies in the face of all reason and logic. Were those who composed the great Bhakti music ‘left-wingers’? Were the great composers of ancient India who produced some of the greatest works of literature ‘left-wingers’? Just as not a single creative individual until the 18th Century were left-wingers, more likely than not, there will come a time in the future when left-wing ideas will lose favour among creative individuals. As a wise man once said, men is always caught in the eternal present. And unfortunately, people believe that what is now shall always be. However, through the ages, enlightened men have always cautioned us: This too shall pass. Therefore, if Dhruv Rathee had the semblance of common sense and could cut down on his arrogance borne of unparalleled ignorance, he would have realised that there are certain conditions related to the very specific circumstances that prevail today which give people the impression that creative individuals are naturally ‘left-wing’. But this is an illusion that is generated due to a well burnished elaborate structure of incentives and inhdoctrination. The Will of the Cathedral There exists an elaborate network of multinational corporations, universities and civil society organisations which work together to dictate what is permissible for public consumption and what is not. The mainstream media and the entertainment industry serve as the propaganda wing of this structure. The neo-Reactionaries of the 21st century call this structure the ‘Cathedral’, an ironical jibe towards the fact that although the structure promotes a materialistic ideology that is antithetical to traditional religions, the ideology is essentially a sect of Christianity. Over time, with significant organised effort, the ideology has managed to capture all the prominent institutions in the West. From Universities to civil society organisations to the mainstream media and the entertainment industry, the ideology dominates every aspect of Western society. The Cathedral engages in what Noam Chomsky calls the ‘manufacturing of consent’. This great beast has employed the considerable resources at its disposal to de-legitimise every other political thought. The ideology, of course, is Progressivism, the official doctrine of the left-wing today. Unlike the West, the Cathedral has not been able to capture Indian society entirely due to a few obvious reasons. Firstly, it is an ideology that is entirely foreign to India and hence, it is not as suited for Indian society as it is for its native countries. Secondly, traditional religions are very dominant in India and the roots of Hinduism in India are still very very strong. However, it has managed to make great inroads. It has almost total control over the entertainment industry as of now and as the election manifesto of the Congress party demonstrated, it has hijacked the biggest opposition party of India as well. Simultaneously, the entire ‘civil society’ nexus in India, which is almost entirely controlled by the West, is an integral part of this cathedral as well. Also, due to the lack of educational reform, the Cathedral has hijacked Indian Universities as well. It is due to the growing influence of the Cathedral in the entertainment industry and Indian Universities that it gives one the impression that creative individuals by their nature left-wing and will always be so. In reality, it is due to the indoctrination of our youth in Universities that the most intelligent among them endorse Progressivism as an ideology. And it is due to the financial incentives offered by the Cathedral that progressive works of art dominate the institutions of mass production. It might appear ironical but Left-Wing ideology in the 21st century is spread entirely by Big Business. The dominance of left-wing politics in the entertainment industry works in two phases. Firstly, Universities ensure that the youth is indoctrinated en masse in progressive ideology. And secondly, it is ensured that works of art that promotes the said ideology are incentivised through financial means. For instance, while mediocre progressive-sounding movies are funded and released on Netflix and in theatres, it is inconceivable that a movie or web series that depicts Hindutva in a positive light will ever see the light of day. For instance, while movies and web series that demonises Hindus and Hindutva can be found in abundance, a venture that treats Nathuram Godse fairly and refrains from demonising him will never be funded and if somehow enough funds are generated to create a good enough product, finding a platform for it will be almost impossible. That is how left-wingers dominate the entertainment industry. It is not because their product are inherently superior, it is because progressive works of art are capable of generating enough financial support. Furthermore, it is also essential that people in the industry air the right opinions or they are ‘cancelled’. Due to the uneven structure of the whole situation where individuals and works of art are not judged on the basis of merit alone, left-wingers tend to dominate the field. However, with the advent of Narendra Modi and the mainstreaming of Hindutva, a handful of movies have been produced which do not toe the progressive line. And with the continued dominance of Hindutva, it is almost inevitable that ‘left-wing’ ideology will lose prominence in the entertainment industry as well. Dhruv Rathee: A servant of the Cathedral The disproportionate influence of the Cathedral has also created a horde of idiots such as Dhruv Rathee who are convinced of their moral superiority and higher intellect merely because they are capable of mouthing the approved talking points. The ‘Champagne Socialists, or the ‘Status-Quo Revolutionaries’, do not realise that the opinions they voice are not controversial in elite circles at all and that they are essentially advocating for establishment talking points. But the illusion created by the Cathedral is so strong that such dim-witted individuals unironically believe that their opinions find greater prevalence among creative people not due to indoctrination but due to the inherent intellectual superiority of their beliefs. The fact of the matter is, creativity and empathy are personality traits that have existed in people since the dawn of humanity. Under current circumstances, people who score high in these characteristics tend to fall in a specific political category but it does not always have to be so. The political dynamics of the 21st Century are transient and they will change in the near future and when they change, things that might appear true as of today will not hold true then. Even now, traditional art is produced almost entirely by conservatives and ‘right-wingers’. For instance, only a fool would call folk music ‘left-wing’. It’s just the Cathedral does not deem it fit for mass production. Thus, ‘midwits’ of the Left such as Dhruv Rathee who work under the false impression that they are somehow superior intellectually to everyone by virtue of the slogans they endorse should try to gain a better understanding of circumstances instead of taking every opportunity to advertise their ignorance. The opinions on the left-wing and right-wing as aired by Dhruv Rathee are good for self-aggrandisement on social media and for lazy attempts at taking swipes at political opponents. However, they do not have any basis for truth. But when these are spouted often enough as grand facts, it further acts as self-affirmation for already indoctrinated individuals and raises a generation of highly confident ignorant deluded clowns such as the propagandist himself.",Right

625,625," Hong Kong will quarantine residents of a roughly 400-unit apartment building for 21 days and test all of the city’s foreign domestic helpers after finding the first locally acquired case of a Covid-19 variant., The infected person was a 39-year-old domestic helper living in a building in the Caribbean Coast complex in the Tung Chung neighborhood, the government said. A 10-month-old baby who lived with her was also infected, it said., All foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong will need to be tested for Covid by May 9, Food and Health Secretary Sophia Chan said at a Friday evening briefing. Exemptions will apply to helpers who have completed two vaccine doses at least 14 days prior., Domestic helpers will be required to be vaccinated in order to renew their contracts, officials said., “The reason is not to have any prejudice against any particular group, the whole consideration is about risk,” said Secretary for Labor and Welfare Law Chi-kwong. “The nature of their work is looking after family members, and many of them are very elderly. Also because of them staying in Hong Kong, during the rest day, they have to meet friends, take a break but then that may cause a risk of cross-family infection, so the whole consideration is a matter of risk.”, The building was locked down starting Thursday night. All residents were required to take Covid tests, and will be taken to serve their three-week quarantine in government centers even if they test negative., Ronald Lam, controller of the government’s Centre for Health Protection, said Thursday night that the source of the person’s infection remained unknown, and that preliminary test results showed the variant N501Y, which was first found in South Africa, and a mutation, E484K, which may help the pathogen resist vaccines and antibody treatments., “Given it is the first locally infected case in the community involving mutant strains and it also transmitted to one of the family members, we think the situation is very grim,” Lam said. “We have to conduct a series of measures for prevention and control.”, The lockdown of an entire building could fuel frustration with Hong Kong’s erratic Covid response, with business owners and residents alike angered by inconsistent and confusing measures, including the stopping and starting of in-person school classes and byzantine new rules for restaurants that can stay open later if staff and patrons have been immunized., Kabeeta Gurung, 49, a resident of the building in Caribbean Coast who runs an international kindergarten in Tung Chung, talked about the lockdown., “It’s very well managed but at the same time it’s very contradictory,” she said. “The protocols for testing were amazing. The booths were set up and the fences put up, but we were all herded, literately hundreds of us -- I was sort of backing into someone’s back.”, Gurung said she was fully vaccinated and had received her second dose more than two weeks ago. “What’s the point of getting vaccinated? Why couldn’t they done a home quarantine?” she said., The city is working to incentivize vaccinations, but its rollout is being hampered by a perceived lack of urgency amid low daily caseloads, distrust of local government messaging following unprecedented unrest, and widespread public concern about the effectiveness and the extremely rare side effects of vaccines., People coming from Hong Kong who are participating in a quarantine-free ,  with Singapore due to start next month must have had two vaccine doses at least 14 days before flying., ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center
356,356," A Hong Kong court added 10 months to pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong’s jail term, as authorities deepen their crackdown against political opponents., The ruling by Hong Kong’s District Court came Thursday after the 24-year-old recently pleaded guilty to taking part in an unauthorized assembly in 2020 — a crime punishable by ,  five years in jail. Wong and thousands of others held a vigil on June 4 to commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, defying an unprecedented ban on the event that authorities said was necessary due to the pandemic., The sentence represents the latest setback for the pro-democracy movement, which has been under siege since Beijing imposed a national security law on the former British colony last year, giving authorities extensive powers to tackle dissent. Aside from Wong, the subject of a 2017 Netflix documentary, authorities have charged or jailed dozens of opposition figures, including media mogul Jimmy Lai, triggering condemnation from the U.S. and other Western governments., “It’s important to point out that thousands if not tens of thousands of people commemorated June 4 despite the ban or Covid restrictions across the city,” said Maya Wang, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch., “There is a campaign of selective prosecutions in the city, which seems to be aimed at putting behind bars prominent pro-democracy activists for years to come, with the intention of effectively dismantling Hong Kong’s pro democracy movement.”, Wong’s total prison term now stands at 27.5 months after a court extended it for a second time. He was initially serving a 13.5-month sentence for leading a protest outside police headquarters in 2019. A court then added another four months in April for violating a mask ban and joining another unauthorized rally., He’s also charged with subversion in a ,  involving 47 defendants — including many former lawmakers — for helping organize a primary election that authorities said was the first step in a plan to vote down the budget and force the resignation of the city’s chief executive. That charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison., Three other activists received jail sentences Thursday ranging from four months to six months for participating in the June 4 vigil, an annual ritual in the city that was halted for the first time in 2020., Officials have decided to ban the event again this year because of the pandemic, according to the , . Hang-tung Chow, vice chairwoman of Hong Kong Alliance, said the group that has for years organized the vigil applied to the police for a letter of no objection so it could hold it again next month but hadn’t received a reply., Courts in the past would issue fines for unauthorized assemblies instead of handing out prison terms, said Ivan Choy, a senior lecturer specializing in the Asian financial hub’s politics at Chinese University of Hong Kong., “So these kinds of sentences are sending society a message that in the future if you try to attend them, there will be a high cost,” he said., ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Left

The induction of four former civil servants, the elevation of leaders like Piyush Goyal to railway minister and Nirmala Sitharaman to defence minister, who are part of Arun Jaitley’s coterie, the exit of old guard like Kalraj Mishra and the absence of any member of the Mardarshak Mandal at the swearing-in ceremony are a few things that indicate a trust deficit and a power struggle in the Bharatiya Janata Party’s rank and file.

Let’s begin with the resignation of the BJP’s old guard. Though most of the ministers who were asked to make way for new candidates on the grounds of non-performance, the resignation of Uma Bharati and Kalraj Mishra from the portfolios they held before the reshuffle bears the stamp of Modi’s style of settling scores. In the reshuffle, Bharati has been cut to size. The Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation portfolios she held have been assigned to Nitin Gadkari, whose fiat will now run over road and water. But Bharati, who skipped the swearing-in ceremony, has been accommodated in the Cabinet with the Drinking Water and Sanitation portfolio.

Relations between Uma Bharati and Modi have always been turbulent. It reached its crescendo after she was expelled from the party in November 2004 when Bharati had a public falling out with L K Advani. Since then, till her re-induction into the BJP, Bharati was known for gunning at senior BJP leaders with Modi almost, every time, in her firing range. After she founded the Bharatiya Janshakti Party in April 2006 in Ujjain, she even called Modi “vinash purush” (man of destruction). She alleged that the people in Gujarat were “fear stricken” under Modi’s government. People close to BJP president Amit Shah and Modi swear to the fact that these two men from Gujarat are not known for their “forgive and forget” policy.

“Uma Bharati was handed a cabinet portfolio by Modi only because he didn’t want her to create some trouble during the early period of NDA government formation,” a senior BJP functionary told Newslaundry. “Modi was looking to boot her out and decided that this the right time.”

Bharati, on the other hand, was not happy with her portfolio and was miffed at not being given enough importance within the party. But to avoid public embarrassment, the party leaders are maintaining that it was Bharati who offered to resign citing health issues.

Similarly, Kalraj Mishra, an old Advani loyalist, was not on good terms with Modi and was shunted out for the same reason. Mishra is likely to be pacified with a Raj Bhavan posting.

The absence of veterans and members of the Margdarshak Mandal, including Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, from the swearing-in of new cabinet members, shows the old guard and Advani loyalists have no place left in Modi’s inner circle.

The expansion also points to the fact that Finance Minister Jaitley still wields enough clout in the party. Goyal and Sitharaman, who have got the important portfolios, are Jaitley’s recommendations.

Talking about bureaucrats handpicked by Modi, it’s an indication that he is struggling to find, within the party, leaders who could help him stabilise his cabinet.

All the nine ministers of state are new faces and include Shiv Pratap Shukla, a BJP member of the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, a BJP Lok Sabha MP from Bihar, Virendra Kumar, a BJP Lok Sabha MP from Madhya Pradesh, Anantkumar Hegde, a BJP Lok Sabha member from Karnataka, RK Singh, former IAS officer and a BJP Lok Sabha member from Bihar, Hardeep Puri, a former IFS officer, GS Shekhawat, a BJP Lok Sabha member from Rajasthan, Satyapal Singh, a former IPS officer and a BJP Lok Sabha member from UP, and KJ Alphons, a former IAS officer.",Left
1003,1003,"The Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed jailed Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s plea challenging his arrest by CBI in alleged liquor policy scam. The high court also dismissed the interim bail plea with liberty to approach the trial court.

""It cannot be said that the arrest was without any justiciable reason. So far as bail application is concerned it is disposed of with liberty to approach the trial court,"" the high court ruled.

A bench of Justice Neena Bansal Krishna dismissed the interim petition filed by Kejriwal challenging his arrest by the CBI.

Last week, the Delhi High Court had reserved verdict in a regular bail petition filed by the jailed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the Excise Liquor policy case. The verdict on regular bail is yet to be announced.

The CBI opposed bail for Kejriwal and said that it has filed the final chargesheet and it is ready to begin the trial. CBI's counsel argued that Kejriwal is the head of cabinet and he signed the New Excise Policy. However, Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi appearing for Kejriwal said that just by signing if Kejriwal becomes mastermind then LG VK Saxena also signed the policy, he should also be impleaded in the case. However, CBI's counsel said that Singhvi was trying to sensationalise the matter.

The Delhi High Court on July 17 had reserved verdict on Kejriwal's interim bail plea and challenge to arrest by CBI. This verdict was pronounced today.

The counsel appearing for CBI told the high court that Arvind Kejriwal is the mastermind behind the alleged Delhi Liquor Policy case as he was the one who appointed ministers and members of the secretariat which includes the main accused Vijay Nair.

There are certain circumstances in which bail can be heard directly by the High Court, but the High Court cannot become the first court for hearing of bail, the counsel for CBI argued.

CBI further told the court that a money trail of Rs 44 crores has been established and that money was used in Goa elections.

Singhvi however argued that most of the statements in the case are based on hearsay. In the previous hearing, Singhvi appearing for Kejriwal had called the CBI arrest an insurance arrest. He had argued that after CBI realised that Kejriwal will walk out in the PMLA case by the Enforcement Directorate, they arrested him from Tihar Jail, where he was already jailed.

498,498," President Joe Biden set a target of 70% of U.S. adults receiving at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by July 4 and said the government will “wind down” mass vaccination sites, as his administration seeks to stem a dropoff in inoculations., Biden said Tuesday at the White House that he’s also aiming for 160 million adults to be fully vaccinated by Independence Day. And he said that if the Food and Drug Administration authorizes Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine for use in children as young as 12, as anticipated, 20,000 pharmacies across the country are prepared to give them shots., “We’re going to have to bring the vaccine to people who are less eager,” Biden said. But he added: “We’re going to make it easier than ever to get vaccinated.”, To help Americans more easily obtain shots, Biden said, the government has begun encouraging vaccination sites to offer walk-in appointments., “Walk into your local pharmacy without an appointment,” he said. “Every adult is eligible. Go get the shot as soon as you can.”, As of now, 56% of U.S. adults, or 145 million, have received at least one dose and nearly 41%, or about 105 million, are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., The U.S. is quickly exhausting the pool of people who want a vaccine and is shifting efforts to focus on those who are less motivated, or who are skeptical about the Covid-19 vaccine. Vaccinating large numbers of people is key to limiting the emergence of dangerous new variants of the virus, health experts say., Biden said vaccine hesitancy can be best overcome by Americans seeing people close to them getting shots without ill effect. “As more and more Americans see their friends and family get vaccinated, they’re making the choice to get vaccinated themselves,” he said., “This is not a Democrat or Republican issue,” he said, though polling shows ,  to have reservations about being vaccinated. “Science behind the vaccines has been under development for decades.”, Biden’s goal would be attainable if the U.S. manages to vaccinate Americans at roughly half the pace as over the past month. Administration officials defended the goals as sufficiently ambitious, saying they would still need to administer close to 100 million doses to adults over the next two months. That pace wouldn’t include additional doses that would be administered to adolescents if the vaccine is authorized for those under 16 years old., Also Tuesday, the White House told governors in a phone call that any unclaimed shots in their states will be redirected to a pool of doses available for distribution elsewhere, according to people familiar with the discussion. The administration had previously allocated shots evenly to states, based on adult population, regardless of how many injections were given., The White House said the administration is making nearly $1.5 billion in funds from the coronavirus rescue package available for community organizations, rural health clinics, and state and local governments as part of the push to increase vaccination and testing rates in underserved areas., Biden’s moves come as the seven-day average of shots has fallen to 2.3 million, from 3.4 million, in about three weeks, according to data compiled by the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. The U.S. administered 1.2 million shots on Monday, the lowest daily total since February, though Monday is typically a slower day for vaccination data., The federal government has delivered 312.5 million doses of vaccines, of which 246.9 million, or 79%, have been recorded as administered., Biden has regularly implored Americans to get a vaccine, avoid large crowds and continue Covid-19 mitigation efforts a bit longer to drive the caseload down in time for July 4 celebrations., ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center

1764,1764,"In 2017, India's Supreme Court outlawed the Islamic practice of ""triple talaq"" which allowed a Muslim man to divorce his wife in minutes just by saying ""talaq"" (divorce) three times. While the court's decision was celebrated by women's rights activists at the time, five years on, many Muslim women say that the ruling has left them in a limbo. Afreen Rehman was elated by the Supreme Court judgement as it made the unilateral, instantaneous divorce given by her husband a few months earlier legally invalid. But contrary to expectations, things didn't change much for her because her husband declined to take her back. Five years later, Ms Rehman, one of the five women petitioners in the case, is unsure if she is still married or a divorcee. This is also the story of three other women petitioners in the case. They are still ""divorced"" as they haven't been taken back by their husbands yet. Zakia Soman, co-founder of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, a rights group that was also one of the petitioners in the case, says that the August 2017 judgment, and the subsequent law in 2019 that criminalised the practice, has had mixed outcomes for Muslim women. ""Their husbands are happily remarried and have children, whereas these women continue [to live] alone,"" Ms Soman says. Before the Supreme Court ruling, India was among a handful of countries that allowed triple talaq. The campaign by Muslim women and activists for outlawing the practice was championed by India's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Subsequently, the lead petitioner in the case, Shayara Bano, was made the vice-chairperson of a women's rights group in the northern state of Uttarakhand, which is governed by the BJP. Ishrat Jahan, another of the petitioners, has also joined the BJP.  But some of the other petitioners are struggling - Ms Rehman has not been able to find a stable job in all these years and Atiya Sabri has won a partial battle for alimony but is constrained to stay with her parents. However, observers say that the top court judgment and the law that criminalised the practice seem to have brought about a change at the social level. ""This has brought awareness in the community that instant triple talaq is not the law of God and our volunteers in different states are reporting that cases are now fewer in numbers,"" says Ms Soman. How Muslim women fought, and won, divorce battle But at the same time, cases of men abandoning their wives appear to have gone up. According to the law, erring husbands are liable to serve up to three years in prison but a lack of awareness is causing many Muslim men to desert their wives, with little accountability. Jameela Nishat, who runs Shaheen Women's Resource and Welfare Association in the southern city of Hyderabad, sent her volunteers to study matrimonial cases in 20 slums of the city after the law's introduction. ""They found that out of 2,106 households surveyed, 683 had women who had been deserted by their husbands,"" she says. ""We used to get two-three cases of desertions earlier, but with the introduction of the law, the cases suddenly went up,"" Ms Nishat says. Uzma Naheed, a former member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, the organisation that opposed the ban on instant triple talaq in court, has observed a similar trend in Mumbai. ""It's happening because men want to avoid giving maintenance to women,"" Ms Naheed says. ""This is very painful. The law has not helped."" Observers say there has also been a noticeable rise in the number of women seeking ""khula"" - a form of divorce initiated by women. Since ""khula"" is granted on the woman's request, the man cannot be held responsible for seeking an instant divorce. The women who fought instant divorce ""We try our best to resolve the matter by organising a dialogue between the parties and most of the cases are resolved amicably,"" says Ansar Alam Qasmi, the head priest at Imarat-e-Sharia, a socio-religious organisation which has its presence in the eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa. ""But, yes, reports from our centres suggest that instances of women seeking divorce have indeed gone up."" Though there is no cross-country consolidated data showing break-ups of instant triple talaq and khula available, The Hindu newspaper found that many Darul Qazas - Islamic arbitration centres - have seen a significant increase in the number of women seeking khula in recent months. It signals a better awareness and a determined pushback from Muslim women, but the practice is also often exploited by men. Khalida Begum (name changed to protect her privacy) from Telangana state learnt it the hard way. She got married in October 2021 but violence at the hands of her in-laws made her seek divorce. The husband declined, and asked her to seek khula instead - which meant she had to forego claims of alimony. She agreed but put forth a condition: he must admit in writing that the reason for khula was the violence he and his family had perpetrated on her. Predictably, he refused. As a way out of the stalemate, Khalida's mother suggested that she drop the condition, but she refused. ""Why should I take the blame for what he has done? He comes out clean but, despite tolerating everything, I seem to be the bad one,"" Khalida told the BBC. Her struggle continues for now. Indian Muslim women fight 'abhorrent' polygamy Ms Rehman is trying to remarry, but has had no luck. ""Her case has been highlighted so much that people are now afraid of Afreen,"" says Naseem Akhtar, a Jaipur-based women's rights activist, who helped Ms Rehman take her case to the Supreme Court. ""The day the verdict came out, Afreen was on every TV channel. Her non-Muslim boss fired her when he got to know about the case, saying 'you are such a shrewd woman that you went all the way to the Supreme Court against your husband. What if you file a case against us?'"" says Ms Akhtar. Her family is supportive, but the thought of remarrying now scares her, says Ms Rehman. ""My life has not changed. I am already a villain."" ""But it must change for future generations,"" she adds.",Center
383,383," , China urged Western nations to stay out of its affairs and fix their own problems after the Group of Seven’s foreign ministers unified behind a litany of grievances with the world’s second-largest economy., The Chinese Foreign Ministry condemned the G-7 statement Wednesday criticizing Beijing’s treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, and urging it “to participate constructively” in the rules-based international system. The developed economies should “stop interfering in other countries’ internal affairs, making groundless accusations in a condescending way and disrupting global epidemic cooperation,” ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said., “These attempts will never succeed,” Wang said, calling the statement “clique politics.”, The rebuke to the G-7 was among a volley of responses to perceived offenses by the West, as the Biden administration tries to rally U.S. allies to present a more united front against Beijing. Earlier, China said it was ,  an economic dialogue with Australia and its diplomats ,  New Zealand because lawmakers there declared human rights abuses are occurring in China’s western Xinjiang region., China has drawn an increasingly hard line under President Xi Jinping against what it sees as meddling in its own internal affairs. While the G-7 statement echoed past communiques, the volume and scope of its complaints -- made at a meeting which this time included Australia, India and South Korea -- signaled greater unity among the nations., “We continue to be deeply concerned about human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang and in Tibet, especially the targeting of Uyghurs, members of other ethnic and religious minority groups, and the existence of a large-scale network of ‘political re-education’ camps, and reports of forced-labor systems and forced sterilization,” the ministers said following two days of talks in London. The G-7 statement also backed Taiwan’s “meaningful participation in World Health Organization forums.”, That message sets the stage for when leaders meet in June in the U.K., where U.S. President Joe Biden will make his G-7 debut. Part of his efforts will be aimed at convincing allies to take a firmer stance against China., Wang, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, urged the G-7 nations to “face ,  their own domestic problems,” including the coronavirus outbreak, before criticizing others. The tone echoed a speech by Xi -- delivered earlier this year, but only ,  Friday -- in which he told Communist Party leaders that China could “clearly see who has done better” in the global struggle against the pandemic., Earlier Thursday, China announced that it was formally suspending a ministerial economic dialogue with Australia, a largely symbolic move showing Beijing’s growing frustration with Canberra. The National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic planner, blamed Australia for the decision, accusing “some Australian government officials” of working to “disrupt the normal exchanges and cooperation between China and Australia out of a Cold War mindset and ideological discrimination.”, “It is disappointing to hear that the NDRC has made this decision,” Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan said in a statement, calling the dialogue an “important forum” to work through economic issues. While the two sides have held three rounds of talks under the mechanism since 2014, it hasn’t convened since September 2017., China also criticized New Zealand after its parliament passed a motion declaring “severe human rights abuses” were taking place against Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, although it stopped short of echoing U.S. accusations of “genocide.” The Chinese Embassy in Wellington condemned the motion, saying Beijing “deplores and firmly opposes such action.”, Still, China signaled a willingness to work with U.S. allies seen as more open to balancing ties between Washington and Beijing. Wang told the briefing Thursday that China wanted to continue communication with Europe to ratify an investment deal announced in December., The Foreign Ministry spokesman also praised New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s recent reaffirmation of the country’s “one-China” policy. Beijing was ready to work with New Zealand to deepen dialogue and cooperation, Wang said., ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center

Within minutes, Meenakshi Sharma becomes eligible for an account with Paytm, joining the hundreds of thousands who have signed up to a payments banking system that is revolutionising India’s retail sector. Before the government’s shock decision in November to withdraw high-value bank notes from circulation, around 90% of everyday transactions in India were in cash. The sudden cash shortage forced millions to join the formal banking sector for the first time, helping Prime Minister Narendra Modi meet a long-term goal. A country of 1.25 billion people, India has only about 132,000 bank branches and 218,000 ATMs -- just a fraction of which are in rural areas. So in 2015, India’s banking regulator offered licences for what are known as payments banks to stop people putting their money under a mattress. This new model can accept deposits -- currently limited to 100,000 rupees (around $1,500) per account -- but unlike traditional banks are prohibited from offering loans and issuing credit cards. They also offer services like ATMs, debit cards and online banking. Another problem was not just that people did not have bank accounts, but that those who did were not using them. According to a recent report by the McKinsey Global Institute, Indians lose more than $2 billion a year in income simply because of the time it takes travelling to and from a bank. “It is no wonder that because of the time and cost required to interact with a bank, many poor and rural individuals opt instead to use cash for transactions,” the report said.",Center

990,990,"New Delhi: “I was not the prime minister who was afraid of talking to the press,” said former prime minister Manmohan Singh on December 18 – an implicit jab at Narendra Modi, who has not addressed a single press conference in the four years of his term.

Speaking at the launch of a five-volume collection of his writings and speeches titled Changing India, Singh pushed back against critics who enjoyed referring to him as “Maunmohan”, or the “silent” prime minister, or even an “accidental” one.     “I used to meet the press regularly and on every foreign trip I undertook,” he said. “I would have a press conference in the plane itself or immediately after landing,”

In contrast, Modi’s contempt for the press has meant that he has only given exclusive interviews to fawning media representatives – and avoided any real, critical questioning from journalists.

Here are 15 questions The Wire would have for the prime minister, if he ever chose to hold an open presser, an unscripted engagement where questions are not screened beforehand and follow-ups are permitted:

§

Jobless growth

1. Employment is one of India’s biggest challenges and during the campaign for the last Lok Sabha election, you had mocked the Congress for failing to deliver one crore (10 million) jobs. Now, four years later, multiple independent estimates say your record on job creation is just as bad if not worse – for example, only 1.4 million net jobs were added in 2017.

Why does your government continue to cite EPFO data as proof of healthy job growth, when a number of economists (including your new chief statistician Pravin Srivastava) say it reflects the formalisation of the economy and not job creation? As for loans under the Mudra scheme, which your ministers have claimed are creating millions of jobs, the actual data makes it clear that most loans are so small that they cannot create any employment, not even that of a pakoda stall.

So, Mr Modi, where are the jobs you promised your voters in 2014?

§

Rural distress

2. Your promise to double farm incomes by 2022 is also completely off target. At last count, farm incomes have grown only at 5% or less over the last four years. At this rate, doubling farm incomes could take more than 14 years.

It took you four years to even make the claim that you will deliver on your campaign promise of an MSP for farmers that is cost plus 50%. But across the country, farmers are forced to sell their crops at less than MSP.  They say the crop insurance scheme you announced is a big fraud – they pay premiums but do not get the benefit.

Your government’s attitude towards the farm sector has triggered some of the largest kisan agitations we have seen in recent years. Your response?          Fiscal matters

3. The NDA-II government accused the UPA of fiscal profligacy and playing fast and loose with deficit numbers. Yet your government has used of a number of ‘creative’ accounting techniques, including rolling over subsidy payments, relying heavily on extra-budgetary resources, funding the deficit through small saving schemes and using PSUs to carry out disinvestment. How does this square with your claims of fiscally conservative, minimum-government policies?

§

Bank defaulters and defrauders

4. Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan sent you in February 2015 a list of billionaire bank defaulters who had actually committed fraud and who needed to be prosecuted. What action did you take to investigate and prosecute those names? Why are you and your government reluctant to make that list – and the action you took – public? A parliamentary committee has sought that information from the PMO as have numerous RTI applicants but you have refused to divulge anything. Why?

Secondly, your ministers say the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is the NDA government’s response to the NPA crisis that started during the UPA-era. But recent steps – like sparring with the RBI over the central bank’s February 12 circular, or asking Public Sector Banks to come out of the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework – undermine the agenda to fix the banking system. How do you justify these two steps?

§

The demonetisation disaster

5. You said on November 14, 2016 that if your demonetisation decision turned out to be wrong, you would be prepared to face any punishment.

Well, the RBI itself said recently that demonetisation has had a marginal-to-low impact on extinguishing black money (99% of all the money you demonetised came back into the banking system), curbing fake notes, reducing currency in circulation and lowering the proportion of high notes in the economy. There has been some spurt in direct tax collections but this has happened in the past too. Your ministers say the money in bank accounts will now be probed by the tax authorities but the income tax department will take years to do this.

So what did demonetisation achieve and was the cost worth it? Recently, a cabinet minister told the Lok Sabha that your government has not even bothered to measure the social and economic impact of demonetisation.  In a recent campaign speech you even made light of the deaths that happened during the notebandi crisis.  Now, Gita Gopinath, the new IMF chief economist, has estimated that quarterly GDP growth declined by at least two percentage points because of demonetisation. Don’t you think as prime minister that you should have ordered a study of the impact? Who did you consult before you took this decision? Were you not aware of the macro disruption that would follow?

The caged parrot

6. The CBI is facing a credibility crisis. When you were in the opposition you called it a caged carrot but that is still what it is. It is very active in probing old cases against your political rivals, including Lalu Prasad or P. Chidambaram but refused to go on appeal when a lower court discharged your political ally, Amit Shah, from a murder case before the trial had even started.  Similarly, no action has been taken against those who face corruption charges but are now your allies or new members of the BJP – including Mukul Roy or Narayan Rane. Is the CBI selectively pursuing cases for your political gains?              The hate factor

7.  In your first Independence Day speech, you said there should be a 10 year moratorium on communalism but various estimates conclude that hate crimes have increased, and at least 314 people have been victims of mob assaults, during your tenure. Thirty-nine people have been reportedly killed in incidents of lynching and attacks on Dalits and Adivasis have increased by almost 25%.

Your own party leaders, MPs, ministers and Sangh Parivar associates make communal speeches on a daily basis. A group of 80 retired civil servants have called on your handpicked UP chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, to resign for his “agenda of bigotry and majoritarian supremacy”.  Why have you been silent in the face of the communal campaign of your party colleagues, and violent attacks on Indian citizens? When Dalits in Una were attacked, you spoke out, perhaps because the BJP sees Dalits as a potential vote bank. But you have not uttered a word about the way Muslims have been targeted. Doesn’t ‘sabka saath’ include them?        The Rafale mystery

8. You announced the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft during your visit to Paris on April 10, 2015. Under the Defence Procurement Guidelines, a formal process should have been followed within the IAF and the Defence Ministry before you made your announcement but your government did not provide any information to the Supreme Court about this, focussing only on what happened after you returned. So could you please tell us what formal steps were taken within the government before you made the announcement, why you scrapped the Make in India and transfer-of-technology component of the original deal and ended up paying three times as much per aircraft?

§

Babri and Ayodhya

9. You and your party are committed to the construction of a Ram temple at the site where the Babri Masjid stood before it was demolished in 1992. Do you believe the demolition of the Babri Masjid was a serious crime for which the vandals and those who hatched the conspiracy should be punished? Can you give an assurance that (i) your government will not try and subvert the process by passing a law or ordinance and that (ii)  you will accept the Supreme Court’s verdict on the title suit regardless of the outcome, even if it decides the disputed land belongs to the Muslim litigants?

§

Kashmir impasse

10. Most experts say that the Kashmir Valley has never felt as alienated as it has in recent years.  You have ruled the state for four years, first as a coalition partner and now directly. The number of civilian casualties has gone up. The number of young Kashmiri men joining militant organisations has gone up. You have taken no serious political initiative to resolve grievances within the state. Instead, you have allowed tensions to build up over Article 35A of the constitution. How do you intend to proceed in the state?",Left
48,48,"The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s judicious airport habits have saved the country millions, claimed the Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Lok Sabha on Wednesday. Shah asserted that PM Modi has shunned the tradition of booking a hotel during technical halts on his foreign visits for refuelling of aircraft and instead stays at airport terminals.

Replying to the debate about the Special Protection Group (Amendment) Bill 2019, Shah said, “In the past when prime ministers travelled overseas, a hotel was booked for an overnight stay during technical halts to get fuel. Narendra Modi has till today not booked a hotel during a technical halt. He waits at the airport, takes bath there and moves further after refuelling is done. He has initiated the practice of taking less than 20 per cent of staff along with him on his foreign visits. There was an arrangement of separate vehicles for the accompanying staff. He said that four to five people should go in a car or a bus which should be provided.”

Responding to the aspersions raised by Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi, Shah clarified that PM Modi has not violated the SPG protocol during a seaplane ride in Gujarat.

Taking a jibe at the Congress leaders and Gandhi family, Shah said that though PM Modi subjects himself to tough norms, there are others who consider security cover as a status symbol. Congress leaders on Wednesday had created a ruckus after security cover provided to Gandhi family members was downgraded.

Targeting the Gandhi family members for repeated violations of SPG cover, Amit Shah listed down the number of instances when the SPG cover was flouted by the Gandhi family. He claimed that on more than 600 occasions, member of Gandhi family went on a trip without taking their SPG cover. Rahul Gandhi, according to Shah, violated SPG norms about 1892 times while travelling in India and about 247 times on his foreign tours since 2015. Essentially, Amit Shah asked the Gandhis why they were so secretive about their trips.",Right
1706,1706,"Ban on 'The Kerala Story': SC seeks response of Tamil Nadu, Bengal govts
'The Kerala Story' directed by Sudipto Sen has received polarising views with some calling it a ""propaganda"" film
The Supreme Court on Friday sought replies of the West Bengal and Tamil Nadu governments on a plea of the producers of ""The Kerala Story"" challenging the ban in the two states.

A bench of Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice PS Narasimha questioned the West Bengal government saying the film is being screened in the rest of the country without any problem and there appears to be no reason for the ban.                  ""Movie is running in the rest of the country including in states having similar demographic composition and nothing has happened. This has nothing to do with the artistic value of the film. If people do not like the movie, they will not watch the movie,"" the bench told senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for the West Bengal government.

Singhvi said according to intelligence inputs, there may be a situation of law and order problem and peace among different communities may be breached.               The bench also asked the Tamil Nadu government to specify measures taken to provide adequate security to theatres screening ""The Kerala Story"".

""The state government cannot say that it will look the other way when theatres are attacked and chairs are being burnt,"" the bench told advocate Amit Anand Tiwari, appearing for Tamil Nadu government, after he submitted that there is no ban on the movie.                   Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for producers of the movie, said there is de facto ban in Tamil Nadu as theatres screening the movie are being threatened and they have dropped the screenings.

""For West Bengal, we are seeking quashing of the ban order,"" he said.                   ""We are issuing notices to both the states and they may file their response by Wednesday. We will take up the matter on Thursday,"" the bench said.

""The Kerala Story"", starring Adah Sharma, was released in cinemas on May 5. Directed by Sudipto Sen, the film claims women from Kerala were forced to convert to Islam and recruited by the terror group Islamic State(IS).                            ",Center

581,581," Scottish Conservative Party Leader Douglas Ross said U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson should quit if he’s found to have broken rules over the funding of refurbishments to his official residence., Johnson is under investigation over who paid for the works to his apartment and when, and whether those payments were declared properly. He’s insisted there’s been no wrongdoing and that he met the costs himself. Asked whether the premier should quit if he’s found to have broken the Ministerial Code, Ross told BBC News, “Of course.”, “People should expect the highest standards of those in the highest office of the land,” Ross told the “Andrew Marr Show” on Sunday. “It’s right that we look to have serious questions answered.”, The comments from a Conservative Party ally add to pressure on the prime minister, who’s repeatedly refused to say whether he took an undeclared loan from a political donor to cover the costs of refitting his Downing Street apartment. Three inquiries have been called into the matter, with the opposition Labour Party pushing for a ,  into whether Johnson broke rules governing members of parliament., “It’s appalling that we are in a situation where he won’t come clean about who lent him money or gave him money and what favors or promises may have been given in return,” Labour Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy told Sky News’s “Sophy Ridge on Sunday” show. “This is a prime minister who frankly thinks that the rules don’t apply to him and his friends.”, Johnson has faced weeks of negative coverage from the U.K. media over “sleaze” allegations tied to the flat refurbishment, and access to ministers enjoyed by officials at the now-insolvent lender Greensill Capital, including former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron., The Electoral Commission, which regulates political donations, announced a probe into the refurbishment last week, saying “there are ,  to suspect that an offense or offenses may have occurred.” Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and Christopher Geidt, an independent ,  on ministers’ interests, are also investigating the matter., Johnson, for his part, has called the story a “farrago of nonsense,” and during heated exchanges in the House of Commons on Wednesday he denied any rules were broken. He was asked three times by opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer to say who initially had covered the costs of the work, but declined to name anyone., On Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab declined to be drawn on a Sunday Times story that a second invoice on the works to Johnson’s flat was settled by a Tory Party donor directly with the supplier., “The prime minister has been crystal clear about it,” Raab told Sky. “He has covered the cost himself, he’s followed all the relevant codes of conduct at all relevant times, he took official advice all along the way.”, The whiff of scandal threatens to weigh on Conservative prospects in local elections taking place across much of the country on Thursday. An Opinium poll for the Observer on Sunday showed the Tory lead over Labour has narrowed to five percentage points from 11 over the past week., Still, a second poll for the Sunday Telegraph projected the Tories would take power in an additional 13 councils while Labour would win six that it didn’t previously control. Raab, for his part, said voters haven’t brought up the issue of the prime minister’s flat., “I’ve been out campaigning in the local elections,” he said. “Genuinely, no one has asked me about this.”, ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center
1668,1668,"The Supreme Court has quashed the FIR lodged against BJP MP Anurag Thakur, former Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal and others in connection with alleged irregularities in granting land to build a cricket stadium in Dharamshala.
A bench of Justice A. K. Sikri, Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice Ajay Rastogi approved the appeal of Anurag Thakur, Dhumal and Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association challenging the Himachal Pradesh High Court order of April 25, 2014, refusing to quash the FIR lodged against them and stay the criminal trial pending before the special judge, Dharamshala. The case was registered for cheating and criminal conspiracy, and under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, during the reign of the then Virbhadra Singh government of Congress party in the state. “We approve the appeal. The FIR lodged is cancelled”, the court said.

In a previous hearing, Virbhadra Singh had contended before the court that in the year 2002, the Dhumal government had leased 16 acres of land at the rate of Rs 1 per year to Thakur for 99 years. He clarified that it was not a political matter but that of irregularities and the police had taken action on it. He requested the court that the appeal of Thakur should be rejected and the stay on the trial against all the accused should be lifted.

The former Himachal government had registered a total of 7 cases in this matter out which 2 were quashed by the High Court. The lawyer representing the Himachal government had told the court that the government has decided to withdraw all politically motivated cases. The court had asked the government whether the case of Thakur was one such case. And If yes, then how. The court also had asked whether the case could be withdrawn. To this, the counsel of the Himachal government said that he would come with instructions from the government.

The court had asked Thakur whether he wanted to argue the matter or the court should permit the state government to withdraw the case from the lower court. Thakur had chosen to argue the matter before the court, after which the court fixed a final hearing in the matter.

121,121,"This story is part of a series on the everyday heroes of rural Maharashtra.Sambhaji Bhor is not tired of selling calendars. He greets me with a smile and asks,  Is it 10.30 am ?  With the rains and scorching heat leaving everyone confused in the village, Sambhaji is steadfast about reaching Pune. He is not venturing out to sell calendars on this day though.  Today, our group of friends will meet and discuss the issues of the disabled and will fight for it collectively.  I lost my eyesight at the age of three,  he narrates as we talk in his village Wade Bolhai in Pune s Haveli taluka. He couldn t complete his education beyond grade X because of the financial constraints. 41-year-old Sambhaji is brutally honest about his experiences battling the society which once disdained him for his impairment. Work for the society. Be independent,  he says proudly. That s exactly the way in which people from the nearby villages describe him. His achievements spread across two decades triumphed over the name shaming he was subjected to. Today, Sambhaji has been actively involved in fighting for the rights of the disabled. This has taken him to several protests, each leaving him with more passion than ever before to fight for the cause.Bitter experiencesIn 1998-99, Sambhaji boarded the Kesnand-Wagholi bus. The bus conductor misbehaved and pushed him which led to a minor head injury. Angered by the incident, Sambhaji found his batch number and filed a complaint in the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited [PMPML] head office in Pune city.  No one has misbehaved with me in the bus after this incident,  he says.Bus experiences were his first encounters with the conservative folks and the way they had labeled the disabled. He has a bank of experiences to draw from, each conveying the story of inhumanity and the cruelty which people had resorted to.In 2008-09, he and his friend Sanjay Bhairat wanted to book a Dadar-Pune railway ticket.  The fair for visually impaired people was Rs 14 then, but the railway officer was charging us Rs 16,  he remembers. The fair was hiked because of the introduction of  additional facilities for the disabled  by the Indian Railways. Unaware of this, Sambhaji questioned the official about the increased fair. However, the official swore cuss words at both the friends and said,  You are blind, why do you need to know about this,  he remembers.Immediately, Sambhaji went to the senior official and spoke about the incident.  Finally the officer had to apologise and tell us about the increased fair. Everyone has the right to know and I was just doing that,  he says proudly. These incidents have made him vocal about several issues lingering around for decades now.Selling calendars Now I don t have to shout in the streets and villages [to sell calendars], people know me,  he says proudly. For the past two decades, Sambhaji has been selling calendars. This started off in the late 1990s when one of his uncles suggested him to make a living out of it. The piece of advice changed Sambhaji s life as he embarked on the journey of traversing villages. He sells calendars in the villages of Haveli, Shirur and Daund taluka in Pune district.  There is enough work for nine months a year,  he says. In November and December, he sells calendars in the schools and offices of Pune city. For this, every day he walks six kilometers to the nearby Kesnand village to take the bus to other villages of Pune district.Due to the infrequent bus facility, he prefers walking to the nearby villages of Ashtapur, Pimpri Sandas, Manjari Khurd, and Awhalwadi. Previously, he used to travel all the way to Baramati and Mumbai in Maharashtra to sell the calendars.  Now, I don t get time to travel so far,  he says. Everyday he carries at least 350 long calendars with him in a blue coloured travelling bag which weighs around 20 kg.He sells Urdu, Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and English calendars. In 2000, he had to buy them from Dadar for which he would commute by train alone. After four consecutive years, he then found an agent in Pune city who would supply it. In this journey, he witnessed a lot of experiences, both good and bad.  Once in the market, a man didn t pay for the calendar. Immediately, a few people ran and caught him,  he says. Another experience worth remembering is that of a man who didn t pay him for the calendar, but returned after two years, paid Rs 20 and apologised.Every day he leaves at 7.30 in the morning and comes back at around 7.30 pm after travelling to several villages.  A lot of people who have now become good friends drop me if I get late in the evening,  he says smilingly. While sitting in the weekly markets, a lot of people have taken calendars from me but never paid,  he says. Now he asks people to pay beforehand. On an average, Sambhaji manages to earn Rs 25,000 yearly from this business.Finding successSuvarna Bhor, Sambhaji s wife, 42, couldn t complete her education beyond grade XII because of the finances. For 12 years, she worked as a nurse in the hospitals in Pune city and before that as a telephone operator in a firm in Amravati city of Maharashtra.At the age of three, she was diagnosed with 52 percent Polio. One day, Sambhaji s elder brother who was being treated in the hospital [Pune city] spoke about Sambhaji s plight and how he couldn t get married because of the disability. Suvarna overheard the conversation and decided to marry him.  As a nurse, I always accept all the patients and help them. I thought of helping such a man and change his life,  she says. Her decision was met with a fit of rage as her parents decided not to show up for the marriage. My parents said marriage is not a drama. How will you live with him?  she recollects. She was faced with terrible word shaming from several acquaintances.  One of my friends asked won t you be ashamed of marrying a blind man.  His uncle who is a Police Sub Inspector later convinced the family members and supported Suvarna.  After several years now, my friends say that I made the right choice,  she says.Generating hopeIn 2007, Suvarna then started working as a labourer in a garment factory in the nearby Kesnand village where she was paid Rs 2,000 monthly. After Suvarna s mother-in-law asked them to leave the house, the couple decided to start a grocery shop in the village in 2008.  Initially I thought no one will buy grocery from us. We earned as little as Rs 13 daily for months,  she recollects. Coupled with several instances of disappointment and ostracism faced by the society, the couple didn t lose hope.  We had decided to work at least for ten years before shutting down the shop,  they say. Today, Suvarna manages to earn close to Rs 250 daily from the grocery shop.  If you work hard, it happens. But first, you ve to work hard,  she now says proudly.Under the Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Pension Scheme, collectively Sambhaji and Suvarna get a monthly pension of Rs 900.  The Government hasn t been proactive in helping the disabled,  says Sambhaji. In March 2018 he went to the Azad Maidan in Mumbai for a protest demanding rights for the disabled. After his travels and bitter experiences, Sambhaji has made several friends across Maharashtra and is collectively fighting for the disabled.  We meet every month and discuss the issues,  he says. Suvarna always wonders how he befriended so many people on his travels. What s the point of education, if people don t respect us? We should accept others and not tease them. With my son and me, my husband now has four eyes,  says Suvarna smiling as she rushes back to the next customer.",Left
996,996,"The  Leader of the Opposition was undeniably in well-equipped command of himself, his materials, and of the combined opposition alliance. The interjections thrown at him were met with feisty repartee that seemed to cause unsmiling panic among the most elderly in the front of the treasury benches.           Even the most honourable speaker of the august house had some explaining to do.

Rahul Gandhi clearly could be seen to have arrived, while the venerable prime minister seemed to have declined into petulant grumpiness.

The arrival of the former has come to have registered in popular perception as the result of leg-work extending to thousands of kilometres through the length and breadth of the republic.

The ‘pappu’ of old no longer seemed to be available to cheap mock. However, the declining colossus sought to denigrate and painful unease showed in the crow’s feet around his stern eyes.

After all, what chicanery can you throw at post-election surveys that showed Rahul Gandhi at 36% as the choice of the sacred lands of Uttar Pradesh for prime ministership against Modi at 32%.

Or, the fact that where the grand old party which was declared to have fossilised into antiquity made a 100% jump in its numbers in the House of the People, the mighty Modi who staked everything on his own “guarantee” lost some 20%,  no matter the  depths of unlovely desperation to which his campaign sank.

In his speech, the Leader of the Opposition made critiques that found no persuasive rejoinders.

The one issue, however, which predictably animated the treasury benches was the one that concerned what Rahul Gandhi said about being or not being Hindu.

In the first place, it is palpably galling to the self-appointed proprietors of Hinduism that this Rahul Gandhi should actually have been making studies into the archives of what constitutes the rich complexities of Hinduism, given that most who swear by it rarely bother to dive into its diverse makings through history.

Given the hullabaloo, it may in order to put some facts out among all Hindus of whichever definition or eclectic persuasion.

Those who heard without prejudice of one kind or another what Rahul Gandhi said heard the following: that, in his reading of scripture and the iconography of the Hindu pantheon, to be a true Hindu means being peace-loving, tolerant, truthful, and fearless; and that those who often proclaim themselves to be Hindus are none of these.

When accused by the BJP of brushing all Hindus as violent, the LOP could be heard loudly saying that the BJP did not represent all Hindus, and that, in fact, those who occupied the treasury benches were not Hindus at all.

This contention about who is a real Hindu has been at the heart of cultural/religious claims and counter-claims in the political sphere of our lives, particularly since the rise of Narendra Modi.

Are those who regard Mahatma Gandhi as the greatest Hindu of our times Hindus, or are those who saw him and continue to see his legacy as the chief antagonist to true Hinduism Hindus?

Most crucially, is violence anathema to true Hinduism or is violence a defining feature of the history of Hindutva?

In this medley, the LOP could have drawn knowledgeable support for his dualistic argument from a landmark book,  Hindutva and Violence: V.D.Savarkar and the Politics of History (2022), by Vinayak Chaturvedi.

Chaturvedi is no Congress supporter or closet Leftist. Indeed, he, it transpires, was given the name Vinayak after Savarkar himself.

Chaturvedi makes it clear that his main task in the book has been to understand Savarkar’s universe of thought, and not to praise or rubbish him. In his study of Savarkar’s entire and very considerable oeuvre, Chaturvedi finds that the concept of violence was at the centre of Savarkar’s definition of Hindutva.

Savarkar’s principal conclusion in Chaturvedi’s words was that “Hindus had not only existed in a state of war in the past but they also needed to embrace permanent war as part of their future” for “Hindus understand themselves as Hindus only through acts of violence.”

We do of course know that the Hindutva right wing routinely engages in what is called shastra puja, namely the propitiation of firearms etc.

The contention, thus, that came to the fore as a result of what Rahul Gandhi said in his inaugural speech as LOP remains at the core of our continuing theoretical slugfest about what makes a Hindu a real Hindu; and it is a contention whose ghosts deserve to be exorcised if we are to obtain the sort of cultural stability within the majority community that is conducive to republican ideas.

Taken together, the opening session of the 18th Lok Sabha is likely to go down in the annals of parliamentary history as a watershed in more ways than one.

""They nearly burned us alive,” said Jovanovic, a 68-year-old investigative journalist who writes about government corruption., Jovanovic is the latest journalist in Serbia to come under attack in what opponents of President Aleksandar Vucic and his ruling party say is an increasingly hostile environment for media. His is a country with aspirations to join the European Union in the next decade., The Balkan state has joined an unbroken strip of countries in eastern Europe stretching from the Baltic to the Adriatic Sea where populist parties have taken over state media and denounced critics as spreading lies., Physical attacks, harassment by police and politicians and even the murder of a reporter have drawn condemnation across former communist Europe and are threatening to unravel decades of progress building the rule of law., Attacks against Serbian journalists rose to 102 last year, the most since 2008, including seven physical assaults, according to a ,  compiled by the Independent Association of Serbian Journalists. There were 72 instances of ""pressure,"" which includes harassment by name by politicians and state-backed media., Many place the guilt with Vucic, who was the minister of information for the late strongman Slobodan Milosevic during the war with Kosovo in the late 1990s. The government, led by his Serbian Progressive Party, has pulled advertisement funding from state-owned companies in opposition-linked publications.

546,546," , Europe’s economy is finally turning the corner from its worst crisis in the postwar period after a devastating double-dip recession., Grim confirmation on Friday of another slump in the first quarter still failed to dim prospects for the region that are as bright as they have been since the pandemic struck, with European Union-funded, year stimulus plans also finally taking form last week, and a growth pickup probably already under way., The fiscal ,  waiting to be unleashed -- mostly on Europe’s weak southern economies -- is almost unprecedented and complements central bank emergency support that is locked in well into 2022. The completion of a belated vaccination push looks increasingly like the key remaining unfinished business to secure a sustained rebound., Indeed, the prospect of EU cash flowing as soon as July, with reopenings appearing plausible, mean a recovery is tangible enough for European Central Bank officials to start talking within weeks about slowing stimulus -- so long as progress on jabs keeps coming., “The worst is definitely over for the euro-area economy and the best is still yet to come, though we’ll have to wait a few more months before we get there,” said Neville Hill, an economist at Credit Suisse in London. “We ,  very encouraged that the economy will reopen this quarter and that should allow for a vigorous rebound later this year.”, Another sign of the , ’s gathering momentum revealed itself on Monday with an index of purchasing managers showing manufacturing activity at the highest level in the survey’s 24-year history. Meanwhile the European Commission proposed reopening borders to fully inoculated travelers, a step toward a return to normalcy., The EU fiscal stimulus is designed to sustain the economic pickup after it takes hold, focusing most on the region’s perennially weaker members while dragging it in a greener and more digitalized direction., Italy, the biggest beneficiary of aid and arguably the region’s toughest growth challenge, has lined up grants, loans and its own top-,  ensure a flow of 261 billion euros ($316 billion) in spending., Such is the scope and duration of the bloc’s stimulus plans that some economists are prepared to be optimistic on its outlook., “The plan is quite serious about reducing the economic divide in Europe,” said Marion Amiot, senior economist at S&P Global Ratings. “It’s an opportunity to change the growth outlook.”, S&P says the overall effort could boost gross domestic product in the bloc by as much as 4.1% in the next five years, though Amiot cautions the real impact will be hard to judge until the end of 2022., The damage to repair is widespread, with the economy having gone through two recessions since the coronavirus struck, most recently shrinking 0.6% in the first quarter. That’s on top of a tumultuous decade after the 2008 financial crisis, when much of southern Europe contended with stagnation or deflation., With vaccination campaigns picking up speed across the region, we expect a gradual unlocking from May to help GDP bounce back by 1.6% in 2Q., -Maeva Cousin and David Powell. For the full note, click here, While the EU fund is designed to forever change that narrative, officials know that throwing money at the problem isn’t enough, not least if implementation then falls short in countries with creaking bureaucracy such as Italy., “The ,  is that when you reform public administration and render it more efficient, it helps absorb these investments,” said Felix Huefner, an economist at ,  in Frankfurt. “But it’s clear that with such a large amount of money, this is a big challenge.”, The extent of the euro-area’s ills is also such that even a once-in-a-generation stimulus worth more than 800 billion euros, on top of national support packages, might still be insufficient to shift the destiny of its weaker members, not least if they don’t concurrently pursue pro-growth reforms., In Spain, for example, “the government thinks it will significantly elevate long term growth and reduce inequality,” said Miguel Cardoso, chief economist for Spain at BBVA. “For this to happen, we need an ambitious labor-market reform.”, For now, the prospect of a huge fiscal stimulus coming, combined with existing monetary support, is bolstering the outlook for a robust recovery. ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane even said on Thursday that the economy is at “an inflection point.”, For his central bank colleagues, that augurs a difficult discussion as soon as their June 10 meeting on whether to start slowing emergency bond purchases., But for that debate to take place, just as for the fiscal aid to work its magic, progress in vaccinations needs to advance. Some evidence of that emerged last week as Germany announced a record 1.1 million jabs on a single day, while Italy managed to exceed 500,000 for the first time., “The first priority for Europe is to get the vaccination strategy right,” said Fabio Balboni, an economist with HSBC Holdings Plc. “Until when restrictions are no longer in place, in our view, it’s a little bit like pumping air in a balloon that’s in a box.”, ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center
1551,1551,"At least seven Maoists were killed in an encounter with security forces on the inter-district border of Narayanpur and Bijapur districts in Chhattisgarh on Thursday (23 May) afternoon.

On Thursday morning, security forces received information about the presence of military platoon number 16 and members of the Indravati area committee of the Maoists on the inter-state border.

Following the information, a joint team of security forces set out on an operation from different directions.

The force, comprising around 1,000 personnel, included Bastar Fighters and District Reserve Guards (DRG), led by DSP Rahul Uikey and DSP Ashish Netam, along with teams from the Special Task Force (STF).

The encounter took place within the jurisdiction of Barsur police station in Dantewada, about 10 kilometers inside the Abujhmad forest area.

The operation began around 11 am when Maoists suddenly opened fire on the forces, leading to intermittent firing that continued until evening.

As the forces advanced, they discovered the bodies of seven Maoists “dressed in the uniform of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) along with their weapons"", Indian Express reported.

The encounter site is located 40 km from the Dantewada district headquarters.

This marks the first significant operation in this area in around four years.

Earlier this year, security forces entered the Naxal stronghold of Abujhmad from Kanker and Narayanpur districts. On Thursday, they entered the area from Dantewada.

Abujhmad, spanning Narayanpur, Bijapur, and Dantewada, covers about 4,000 sq km, making it larger than the state of Goa.

On 16 April, forces entered Abujhmad from Kanker, resulting in the death of 29 Maoists.

Subsequently, on 30 April, they entered the Maad area from Narayanpur and killed another seven Maoists.

1378,1378,"What explains the absence of street celebrations following BJP’s landslide victory?
There is an inexplicable lull after the sensational election results. One had expected crackers and lights and fireworks as witnessed after BJP’s win in 2014                                                Exactly four weeks ago on May 23, Indian polity and society took a sharp turn to an uncertain, brave new world. It is not as if the seeds of such a “counter-revolution” were not there. The regressive tendencies were there but most often, they were either restrained or were sometimes even defeated.

Today Lal Krishna Advani may appear a pathetic and lonely figure; but it was he who had released the genie from the bottle. Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have carried forward what he began. But the ideology and the organisational outfit was created 95 years ago when the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was founded in 1925.

Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in a letter to the chief ministers on 7th December 1947, barely four months after his famous “Tryst with Destiny” speech, wrote, “We have a great deal of evidence to show that RSS is an organisation, which is proceeding on the strictest Nazi lines, even following the technique of organisation...The German youth drifted towards the Nazi Party because of the negative programmes of that party which did not require active effort of mind...the Nazi Party brought Germany to ruin and I have little doubt that if these tendencies are allowed to spread and increase in India, they would do enormous injury to our country...No doubt India would survive . But the nation would be grievously wounded and would take a long time to recover”.

Nehru used to say often that his biggest challenge was to bring secularism to people who are deeply religious. He was never against religion as such, but was totally opposed to bring religion into politics. He knew that religious faith as political agenda would polarise the country. He was witness to our own holocaust at the time of partition.

Such partition divides minds and society first, and then the nations, and he had seen this happening in the world. He had a historian’s mind, a global vision and a scientific temper. He did not want yet another partition of the country, though he feared it, as is seen in that letter. This shows the serious apprehensions he had about the Hindu-Muslim divide and where it can lead to. India is a multi-religious, multi-faith, multi-cultural and multi-lingual country with fascinating diversity. Destiny had placed a responsibility on us to preserve it, he felt.

The freedom movement was not just an “anti-imperialist” struggle but was an effort to create an India that would be equal, fraternal and free, a society based on compassion and love, not based on violence and discrimination. These were the values, of sacrifice, of cooperation and a new work ethic.                   The election results in 2014 and 2019 are reflections of how degenerate we have become as a society. However, there are some other things that must not be ignored.

The BJP has about 38 per cent vote and NDA has nearly 45 per cent votes. Even if we presume that the 45 per cent vote of the NDA is for the same polarising forces, still it leaves about 55 per cent of people not influenced by the frenzy generated by the Modi-Shah duo and their RSS mentors. That means the majority is still sane.

This calm sanity has been reflected in the absence of any celebrity fanfare and frenzy on May 23 and during the last month. There is an inexplicable lull after the sensational election results. One had expected crackers and lights and fireworks on the day or night of the results. Even drums and dances and colours hurled as on Holi, victory processions on streets blocking traffic.

Those were the scenes on 16th May 2014. In fact, most large victories lead to such spontaneous celebrations. But interestingly, even BJP offices and Shiv Sena shakhas did not have that kind of exhibitionist exuberance this time around. Not even on days that followed the results.

Ebullient Shiv Sainiks require just an excuse, an occasion to go wild. Even a small by-election for the Corporation or Zilla Parishad victory or even a win by Mumbai Indians in the IPL cricket matches provides them a pretext to launch on euphoric celebrations. But the landslide victory of the National Democratic Alliance this year received a lukewarm response.

Before the results, particularly after the exit polls, there was animated discussions in offices, drawing rooms, in buses and trains. Nobody ever expected a landslide for any party or front. Indeed, every single magazine, all pollsters, all commentators and talking heads on TV shows used to say that the election would produce a coalition—either led by the BJP or by the Congress.
The RSS ideologue Ram Madhav went even further. He declared days before the results that the BJP will accommodate other parties to form a government. He predicted shortfall for the BJP. And yet the results proved to be astounding. Predictions made by Amit Shah and Piyush Goyal proved bang on. But till the results were out, nobody except those two were so sure. Their unshakeable confidence weeks before the counting was done is mysterious indeed

That mystery is further deepened by the fact that till today, the final results, constituency-by constituency, are not yet been released by the Election Commission. About 370 results had a huge mismatch of figures between votes polled and votes cast. But there is a deafening, even sinister silence despite questions being raised.

“Itna Sannata Kyon Hai Bhai”, the exclamation made famous by A K Hangal’s dialogue in a Hindi film, resonates decades later. That “Sannata” has many secrets which need to be revealed. Only then we will know the real election results.

The warning given by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru over 70 years ago must be remembered. We have to overcome and we shall overcome. The majority is still with us!

Foreign secretary David Lammy says UK wants to see a ""peaceful and democratic future"" for South Asian country              The UK government called for a United Nations-led probe into the unrest that led to the resignation of former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina.

Foreign secretary David Lammy said the UK wants to see a ""peaceful and democratic future"" for the South Asian country as Hasina resigned and fled Bangladesh on Monday, 5 August.

However, there was no mention of the asylum for Hasina, which the former Bangladeshi prime minister is seeking.

""The last two weeks in Bangladesh have seen unprecedented levels of violence and tragic loss of life... All sides must work together to restore calm under a transitional government,"" David Lammy said in a statement on Monday.

""The people of Bangladesh deserve a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events of the past few weeks,"" the UK Foreign Secretary said, adding that his country wants to ""see action taken to ensure Bangladesh a peaceful and democratic future.""

Since then, the stance of Hindustan Times seems to have mellowed down and it has issued a clarification about the views it expressed about Manak Gupta: As seen in the clarification, the paper states that its data analysis highlighted tweets liked by Sushma Swaraj which “trolled” her.

1048,1048,"An anonymous letter written by a civil servant, addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has levelled serious allegations against the multinational consulting firm KPMG’s India operations. In the letter, which is dated 5 December, a senior bureaucrat—who claims to be a member of the elite Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and holds the post of a director in the union government—accuses the group of exercising influence over key government officials by, among other means, recruiting their children and relatives. It alleges that there is a pattern of influence among senior officers in the central and state governments and top executives in KPMG India. Other allegations stated in the letter include the purported offer of a bribe to a bureaucrat, and the awarding of crucial government contracts to international firms, to the detriment of  domestic industry.

A KPMG spokesperson strongly denied the imputations of impropriety but did not refute particular claims made in the letter.

The unnamed director writes that the letter was intended to bring to the prime minister’s notice “rampant corruption ... in collusion with private sector MNC consultants.” The author states that they have withheld their identity “on fear of persecution by fellow bureaucrats.” Reliable sources have confirmed to these reporters the authenticity of the letter, which has been doing the rounds in government circles in recent weeks.

Headquartered in the Netherlands, KPMG is one of the “big four” accounting and financial consultancy networks across the world, along with Ernst & Young, PwC (earlier PricewaterhouseCoopers) and Deloitte, all of which have significant operations in India.

The allegations described in the letter are serious. The director alleges that a senior executive in KPMG India’s government advisory services offered a joint secretary posted in their department a “substantial bribe” in exchange for the award of a large consulting project. The director states that the joint secretary declined the bribe. However, the director adds, the joint secretary chose not to report the matter, allegedly in fear of KPMG’s clout among senior officers of the IAS and the Indian Police Service (IPS) in the central and state governments.

The director details the manner in which such clout in the corridors of power is allegedly achieved. They list a number of jobs held in KPMG by relatives of senior bureaucrats, purportedly in order to curry the officials’ favour. Such jobs are well remunerated—earning close to Rs 40 crore over the course of a professional career, according to the letter—and are akin to a “bribe” of a similar amount, the director states.

The officer has listed the names of nine senior officers whose close relatives hold jobs with KPMG—their names are deliberately being withheld in this report. These include relatives of several former and current top officers in the Ministry of Urban Development, including the son of a former secretary in the ministry who is currently posted in the Ministry of Home Affairs, and who earlier served in a key position in Jharkhand. The nephew of an additional secretary in the same ministry and the son of a former joint secretary are listed as well. Importantly, one of these civil servants currently holds a crucial position in Modi’s flagship Smart Cities mission.

Other relatives named in the letter include the daughter of an IAS officer from the Gujarat cadre who served as a secretary in the home ministry and the sons of: a senior IAS officer belonging to the Rajasthan cadre, a former joint secretary in the home ministry who was formerly the chairman of the Airports Authority of India, a former senior IAS officer from the Andhra Pradesh cadre, a former chief secretary of Telangana, and a former finance secretary to the government of India.

The letter alleges that each of these officers were in key positions when their relatives were hired by KPMG, and that the firm was subsequently awarded large consulting projects by the concerned departments. The urban-development ministry features prominently in the letter—KPMG is executing the ministry’s Swachh Bharat and Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) projects. Other flagship government projects with which KPMG is associated and which are mentioned in the letter include Make in India, the Smart Cities mission, the Startup India initiative, the Bharatmala project for roads and highways, the Sagarmala project for ports and maritime development, and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). The letter alleges that consulting firm is associated with government projects involving a total outlay of over Rs 5,000 crore.

Featuring prominently in the letter are also allegations against the India head of KPMG, Arun Kumar. Prior to his appointment to KPMG, Kumar served as the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Global Markets and the Director General of the US and Foreign Commercial Service during US president Barack Obama’s second term. The director claims that in his role as the chairman and CEO of KPMG India, Kumar has favoured American firms for contracts in government missions. The letter claims that American firms such as Cisco, IBM, Dell, Hewlett Packard, Honeywell, United Technologies and Otis have bagged equipment contracts under the prime minister’s flagship Smart Cities programme, to the disadvantage of Indian firms and costing India “lacs of jobs.” This, the director alleges, is linked to KPMG India’s involvement with the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), the arm of the US government that works to advance the country’s business and economic interests globally. The USTDA, the director states, has hired KPMG India to work with the US government to “push US firms into the Smart Cities program.” “Hence tenders are coming out with Cisco equipment specifications, making it impossible for competent Indian firms ... to compete.”

The director alleges that “[s]uch ability to deeply influence Indian government functioning arises from the fact that many of our senior bureaucrats are compromised as their children work for the US MNC consulting firms.” Further, the letter alleges that the malaise is spread across “the Big Four consulting firms, who have practically infested all our governments.” “A quick investigation will reveal that government projects worth over Rs 300,000 crores are being handled by US consulting firms and that atleast 100 top bureaucrats have their children or relatives working in these consulting firms,” the director alleges.

We reached out to KPMG India regarding the allegations contained in the letter. A spokesperson for the firm rejected the accusations and questioned the motivations of the director, terming the letter “instigated and written with malicious competitive intent.” Though the spokesperson said that the letter is “replete with factual errors,” these were not pointed out. Further, the spokesperson did not deny specific claims contained in the letter—such as the employment of the individuals concerned, or the involvement of KPMG India in the projects mentioned, and the alleged roping-in of US firms into Indian government projects. The full statement sent by the spokesperson reads:

The accusations made in this anonymous letter alleging wrong doing in KPMG’s work for the Government of India are totally baseless. KPMG has worked with the Union and various State Governments over the past years with many diverse stakeholders, and has always conducted its business with utmost transparency and the highest standards of integrity and ethics. KPMG is a best-in-class organization that has been operating for over 25 years in India with a solid, irrefutable track record.


Talent at KPMG is recruited solely on the basis of merit and the organization has robust processes to ensure objectivity and fairness in selection and promotions. To suggest that KPMG associates have been hired on account of their parentage and linking its government work to such hires is an affront to the qualifications and expertise of the employees and to the organisation’s world class credentials. We have examined the insinuations in the letter and find them replete with factual errors apart from being slanderous.

It is unfortunate that the writer has stooped to insinuate motives to the KPMG India Chairman who returned to India after a distinguished career in the US, where he played an important and constructive role in the advancement of India-US relations. His work at KPMG India has no relation, whatsoever, with his prior role in the US Government. His work in India only demonstrates his professional and personal commitment to the growth and development of India, the country of his birth.

KPMG notes these allegations are mischievous and emphatically rejects them. Our guess is that the letter is instigated and written with malicious competitive intent.

A top executive employed in one of the Big Four multinational consultancy firms, reacting to the letter on the condition of anonymity, confirmed the prevalence of corrupt practices in the business of consultancy. He said that “in continuation of the policy of privatization of public resources, it appears that a new cosy relationship has evolved between crony capitalists, government officers and consulting firms.” “Given the fire from the CAG (the Comptroller and Auditor General) faced by government officers in earlier cases of alleged attempts to privatize public resources such as the 2G (second-generation telecommunications spectrum) scam, Coalgate, etc, a convenient mechanism has got formulated, wherein decisions of government officers are now based on ‘neutral’ third party consulting firms, reducing the accountability of the officers and the decisions leading to profiteering by crony capitalists,” the executive said.“The crony capitalists gain, the government officers gain as their children get lucrative employment in the consulting firms and the consulting firms gain as they receive hefty fees from public coffers.”

KPMG is not the only firm that has recently been accused of such impropriety—in early February 2018, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the regulator for the securities market in India, banned the Indian arm of PwC from auditing any firms listed in the country, for the forthcoming two years. SEBI took this action against PwC based on its alleged role in the Satyam scam, in which the computer-services company inflated its earnings by close to $1 billion. SEBI stated in its order that the consulting firm, which was auditing Satyam, failed to “independently check the veracity of the monthly bank statements.” The board said that it felt compelled to take a “stern view of ... fraudulent practices, particularly when persons tasked with protecting the interest of investors are themselves hand-in-glove with the main perpetrators of the fraud.”

In the wake of the 2008 global economic crisis, the discourse around wealth inequality and the “revolving door” relationships between major multinational corporations and governments, which foster the maintenance of such inequality, have gained significant prominence. These allegations add to this conversation, and point to a growing familial and caste-community nexus in India that appears to control major levers of governance, public investment and policy, in concert with powerhouse multinationals.

While such a claim—of exercising influence by forming “alliances” with senior government functionaries through the employment of their relatives—may be difficult to prove in court, it is precisely through such ambiguity and the plausible deniability it offers to the concerned officers that the informal networks of power that constitute familial and clan relations can come to capture many of India’s formal institutions of governance.

In conclusion, the anonymous director writes that they are confident that the prime minister will take “swift action” to prevent more “damage” to the country’s interests. The director adds that they are “proud” of Modi, and takes a “pledge” to support his “war against corruption, both from within the government and from private sector.” “I completely believe in your war cry – ‘Na Khayengey, Na Khaneydeyngey’ – ‘I will not be compromised and I will not let others be compromised,’” the director wrote.

The Caravan wrote to the Prime Minister’s Office, enquiring whether any action has been taken on the director’s complaint. At the time this article was published, the PMO was yet to respond. The article shall be updated when a response is received.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor:

My name [is] Sameer Sharma and I am working as Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. An article was published in the Caravan on 23 February 2018, which contains some blackened out names. One of them is a Additional Secretary in the Ministry. The giveaway is the Dr. in front of my name as I am the only Additional Secretary with a doctorate in the Ministry.

I also bring your attention to this line in the letter

The nephew of an additional secretary in the same ministry and the son of a former joint secretary are listed as well. Importantly, one of these civil servants currently holds a crucial position in Modi’s flagship Smart Cities mission

I would like to inform you that no nephew of mine is working in the KPMG. In the Smart Cities Mission, which I oversee, KPMG has not worked earlier or is working as a consultant.

My reputation and name have been besmirched and I have been put to irreparable loss in my service. I call upon you to publish a corrigendum or I will have to take criminal and civil action to re-establish my reputation and name.

Thank you,

SS

469,469," A bipartisan group of U.S. House lawmakers is asking the Biden administration to seek the elimination of Vietnam’s tariffs on American pork and address other restrictions as it engages with the Southeast Asian country over currency and trade practices., U.S. pork producers have failed to gain significant access to pork-loving Vietnam that has seen its domestic pig farms devastated by the African swine fever, increasing the demand for imported pork, according to a letter Wednesday to U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai that was signed by 72 members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats,, However, “significant tariff and non-tariff barriers unfortunately prevent U.S. pork from competing in that country, even as it seeks reliable sources of non-domestic pork,” the representatives said in the letter. “Consequently, our competitors in the EU as well as the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership participants are well-positioned to take advantage of this tremendous opportunity given their free trade agreements with Vietnam.”, Vietnam has culled more than two million domestic pigs and imported hogs in the past two years because of African swine fever. Pork is the meat most Vietnamese rely on for daily protein., Vietnam last year temporarily cut its U.S. frozen pork import tariffs to 10% from 15%. This resulted in a doubling of American exports to the country during the second half of 2020 compared with the first six months of the year, the letter said. The temporary duty reduction expired at the end of 2020., “We reduced import tariffs for American pork last year and Vietnam is actively implementing steps within trade and investment agreements between the two countries to boost bilateral trade,” said Nguyen Do Anh Tuan, spokesperson for Vietnam’s agricultural ministry. “We will continue to work with our U.S. counterparts on measures to help balance our trade ties with the U.S.”, Vietnam has allowed 475 U.S. companies to sell pork and meat products in the country, Tuan said., The representatives said in the letter to Tai that “the past few years have been extraordinarily difficult for U.S. pork producers due to trade retaliation from top U.S. export destinations” as well as disruptions brought about by the coronavirus pandemic., U.S. producers also face restrictions to the Vietnamese market caused by “burdensome” administrative procedures, not recognizing the U.S. pork plant inspection and approval system and inconsistent processes for the import of some pork organ meat, said Maria Zieba, assistant vice president of international affairs for the National Pork Producers Council., ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center

Fatalities in Russia linked to the epidemic rose to more than 85,000 in the first quarter., President Vladimir Putin has regularly boasted about Russia’s response to Covid-19, highlighting domestically-developed vaccines and the country’s economic resilience after deciding against a second lockdown.

562,562," The top diplomats from the U.S. and the U.K. pushed back against what they called Chinese and Russian violations of the global order, pledging unity in what both nations call a priority: uniting democratic societies against autocratic ones., “What we are trying to do is to uphold the international rules-based order that our countries have invested so much in,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a briefing in London alongside U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. “The challenge for us is to demonstrate in very concrete ways that we can deliver for our citizens.”, Raab echoed that view, saying there’s an increasing need for “agile clusters of like-minded countries that share the same values.”, The remarks are an outgrowth of a shared goal for an alliance of democratic nations to present a united front against the abuses that they argue are regularly committed by Russia and China, such as the crackdown on ethnic Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region and Russia’s poisoning of opposition leader Alexey Navalny., That alliance is expected to be a key theme of meetings between the U.S., the U.K. and other members of the Group of Seven, whose representatives will gather alongside counterparts from Japan, India and others in London on Tuesday., Some nations have expressed concern that they’re being asked to pick a side between the U.S. and China, the world’s two largest economies, but Blinken contends it’s mostly an effort to call out China’s refusal to play by global rules. He ,  that it’s the 80th anniversary of the Atlantic Charter, which he said “set the foundation for the international rules-based order that our countries so strongly subscribed to.”, While Blinken had already met and spoken with Raab several times as secretary of state, the meeting Monday gave him the chance to reaffirm the traditional U.S.-U.K. “special relationship.” Blinken said the U.S. had “no closer ally, no closer partner” than Britain., “We’re connected by ties of friendship, family, history, shared values and shared sacrifice,” he said., Prime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to welcome Blinken’s warm endorsement of the two nations’ ties when they meet on Tuesday. Soon after Joe Biden beat Donald Trump for the U.S. presidency in November, concerns arose that the new administration might keep its distance from Johnson in a contrast with Trump, who enthusiastically embraced the British leader’s championing of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union., Biden has made a point of pressing Johnson to maintain the hard-won peace in Northern Ireland, however Brexit plays out., ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center

209,209,"The Congress on July 15 slammed the BJP for its allegation that Rahul Gandhi encouraged violence against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying ""cheap politics"" should not be played on the issue of security of leaders.

The BJP on Sunday targeted the Leader of Opposition following the assassination attempt on former U.S. president Donald Trump.

""Third Time Fail Rahul Gandhi has often encouraged and justified violence against Prime Minister Modi, who he has lost election to, several times now. How can India ever forget how Punjab Police, then under the Congress, deliberately compromised PM's security, when his convoy was left stranded on a flyover,"" BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya had said.

Hitting back at the BJP, Congress' media and publicity department head Pawan Khera said, ""Cheap politics should not be played on the issue of security of leaders. The Congress party lost Mahatma ji to Right Wing terrorists. We lost two prime ministers at the hands of terrorists. We lost our entire Chhattisgarh leadership to Left Wing terrorists, under the watch of the BJP Government.""

Prime Minister Modi and the entire BJP have been instigating people against the leadership of the Congress party by ""spreading vitriolic"" lies against Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and the entire family, he alleged.

1772,1772,"Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana, announced today by the Election Commission for October 21, will be the first in the country since Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the BJP to success in Lok Sabha polls in May. Nearly 11 crore people will vote across the two states in an election that is also the first since PM Modi's government pushed through several key pieces of legislation in parliament's monsoon session, such as the abrogation of Article 370 and the 'Triple Talaq' bill, as well as completing the NRC in Assam. Kick-starting the BJP's election campaign in Haryana, PM Modi reminded voters of some of these 'firsts', saying, ""whatever big decisions were taken, it is in your favour... triple talaq, mand many steps are being taken to strengthen the economy... be it Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh or the water problem, people have started looking for solutions"". In both Haryana and Maharashtra the BJP is likely to rely on the ""Modi magic"" on which it rode to victory in 2014 and 2019 national polls, a hallmark of which was aggressive campaigning by the PM. Opposition hopes the ""Modi magic"" effect has faded over time could be dashed, judging by the ratio of rallies addressed to seats won - in 2014 PM Modi addressed more than 400 rallies and the BJP won 282 seats. Five years later he addressed only 144 rallies but the BJP claimed 303 seats. The BJP, which made the withdrawal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir a poll issue during national elections, followed through with that promise last month. The party is likely to bank on that decision to collect votes in both states. PM Modi has already set the tone in that regard, raising the issue in Nashik and Rohtak, where he spoke of his vision for Jammu and Kashmir - one that embraces Kashmir and recreate it as the ""paradise"" it once was. However, Congress leader Kapil Sibal has warned the BJP the opposition will not play ball and will, instead, focus on issues like unemployment and agrarian crisis. The 'Triple Talaq' bill is another key piece of legislation that could prove influential. The contentious bill was passed after a heated debate in parliament that witnessed walkouts by two key BJP allies - Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) and Tamil Nadu ruling party AIADMK. Haryana is one of several states, including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, to make prompt use of the law. Another issue likely to be key is the NRC exercise that was recently completed in Assam. Political leaders in both Haryana and Maharashtra have called for similar citizenship verification drives, with Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar among those. On Wednesday, Home Minister Amit Shah insisted NRC would be applied across the country and, as such, the topic is likely to feature in the BJP's campaign. This will also be the first election since Rahul Gandhi stepped down as Congress president. The Congress, now under the interim leadership of former president Sonia Gandhi, has struggled to impose itself after two successive disastrous performances in national polls. Coupled with a raft of defections of leaders in both Haryana and Maharashtra, the Congress needs inspiration and an identity if it is to compete with the BJP juggernaut. With that in mind, Ms Gandhi's return may be used by the BJP; while campaigning for national polls PM Modi regularly criticised the Congress for failing to look beyond the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. The economic slowdown - GDP growth went from 8 per cent in the quarter ending June 2018 to 5 per cent in the first quarter of FY 2019/20 - is likely to be a rallying point for the opposition. The dire situation, highlighted by a crisis in the auto industry that has left over 3 lakh jobless, has sparked criticism from the Congress, with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh urging the centre to ""put aside vendetta politics... and steer our economy out of this man-made crisis"". These elections are also the first since unemployment hit a 45-year high. The Congress, which has targeted Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in recent weeks, will be keen to make this the focus of its attack in both states.",Center

883,883,"When a senior leader of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Prashant Bhushan spoke in support of Kashmiri separatists, party supremo Kejriwal was quick to term it as Bhushan’s “personal views”, but he has maintained a strategic silence on the issue of party leaders supporting Khalistani separatists.

Khalistan movement refers to a hardline Sikh demand for a separate country for Sikhs. This demand has never found popular support among common Sikhs as they feel that their interests are well protected within India. However, this movement has always found support from Pakistan.

Khalistan movement was at peak during Indira Gandhi regime with likes of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale leading an armed struggle. But it slowly fizzled out thanks to nationalist Sikhs in Army and politics, who could save India from another partition.

But the movement still finds some support among some areas in Punjab. Earlier this year, pro-Khalistani outfits had declared support to AAP during the Lok Sabha elections.And it worked. The only seats AAP could win anywhere in the country were in Punjab.

But questions should be asked if AAP is playing a dangerous game by going soft on Khalistani separatists for electoral gains?

Although AAP chief Kejriwal has never made a categorical statement about the relationship between pro-Khalistani outfits and AAP, he could argue that he can’t stop anyone from supporting him.

Just like Congress supported AAP during Delhi government formation in December 2013 without AAP asking for it openly, Kejriwal could claim that pro-Khalistani outfits supported AAP in a similar manner.A photograph released by Tajinder Singh Bagga of Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena (see the tweet above) shows Jarnail Singh, an AAP leader who was a candidate from West Delhi in the 2014 general elections, addressing a rally of Khalistan supporters.

As one can clearly see, the rally has posters demanding a separate Sikh homeland of Khalistan, and thus it is asking for the division of India. An unconstitutional and dangerous demand.

The rally took place on 5 June 2011 in London, as confirmed by Bagga to OpIndia.com and it raises serious issues about the relationship between pro-Khalistan movement and AAP.


Will AAP remain silent for electoral gains even if it means that the unity and sovereignty of the country is weakened?

Khalistani movement has been supported by Pakistan, which also supports Kashmiri separatist movement. Isn’t AAP playing into the hands of Pakistan by going soft on such issues?

In fact, it raises serious questions if Pakistan could be funding some of these activities. One is forced to link it with the fact that AAP doesn’t show Pakistan as a country in its donations list.

Check out this official online form for donation to AAP. It shows all countries in the drop-down list except Pakistan. It doesn’t mean that people from Pakistan can’t donate to AAP (nowhere on the website it asks those living in Pakistan to stay away).

It means that people residing in Pakistan will have to choose some other country while making the donation, which means that the donations from Pakistan will be a non-transparent process. This comes from a party that asks for transparency in all walks of public life. Why is AAP afraid of disclosing donations received from Indians living in Pakistan?

AAP should come clean on these issues that hint at the party going soft on Pakistan backed groups such as Kashmiri separatists by Prashant Bhushan and Khalistani separatists by Jarnail Singh.

In fact, this is not only going soft on Khalistanis but now it’s about sharing the stage with Khalistanis after this exposé by Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena.

An AAP leader is seen making demands to break up the country, and the party chief Arvind Kejriwal must speak up now.

The criminals have to be identified, arrested and convicted, come what may. We as citizens cannot do the job of the police. However, as citizens we should speak out against the deliberate and reckless defamation that the Hindu right has faced from large sections of media, the so called intelligentsia and the so called secular political class as a result of this incident. We cannot have crimes judged on the basis of pure prejudice inside a complete vacuum of evidence. To speak out against such shameful conduct, you don’t have to be a right winger. You just have to be a right thinking citizen. Within minutes of the news of Gauri Lankesh’s murder coming in, it looked like the media celebrities and other had already ‘solved’ the crime: Incidentally they even didn’t use the word “alleged” to try and make things a bit fair. They spoke as if they could see in all directions of time and space inside their heads. The next day there was a clear signal straight from the top: But this outright conclusion drawing doesn’t appear to be universal as we saw in the cases like that of “suspected” SIMI terrorists: Also on top of it they were labelled as terrorists, but “activists”. Such inconsistency might lead some to believe that the judgement laden language of certainty is reserved only for speaking against the right wing. Its almost unreal that throughout the day such attacks continued even when there wasn’t a shred of evidence to show that the murderer had anything to do with Sangh or BJP.  No arrest, not even a single lead. Yet, in the minds of some “intellectuals”, the conviction was complete. The media conviction of the BJP and Sangh Parivar yesterday was so ludicrous that terms like “kangaroo court” etc couldn’t possibly capture the extent of the fallacy. We can’t even call it “guilt by association”, because there was no known association of the still unknown assailants. We need a new term for this. Perhaps we can say that BJP and Sangh Parivar were found “guilty by conjecture“? That means they were found guilty simply because someone said they were, or at least because someone desperately wanted them to be. After all that has taken place, the Prime Minister must speak now. He must demand an apology from the media and ‘secular’ political parties for a completely evidence free smear campaign against his party, the cadres of his party, its supporters and its still larger ideological family. There is a strain of apartheid in the way the right wing was defamed yesterday. When Javed Akhtar says that “one kind of people” are getting killed, it means that the death of right wingers is simply not registering in India’s liberal conscience. Why are the deaths of right wingers not registering in their consciousness? Is liberal India refusing to recognise right wingers as human beings? There’s no “undeclared emergency” in India. Instead, we have “undeclared apartheid” imposed by the intellectual class. And the Prime Minister must speak up against this apartheid. Right wing ideology is being blamed even when nobody has a single clue who the killers are. I am yet to see left wing ideology blamed despite repeated massacres carried out by left wingers in the forests of Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh.",Right
986,986,"How the  unimaginable  becomes a hard fact.

A recent post-poll  survey done by the reputed CSDS in the game-changing Uttar Pradesh, shows, among other things, that David has now surpassed Goliath in the prime-ministerial choice of UP-ites.        The survey results show that while 32 per cent of the respondents rooted for  Modi, 36 per cent wished to see Rahul Gandhi as the executive head of the republic.           If the loss in the temple-town of Ayodhya, and Modi’s humiliating  scrapping -through in Varanasi have been clear signs of Lord Ram’s chagrin at the businessification of his identity, pushing the Pran-Pratishtha-doing Modi four percentage points below his chief nemesis, namely, the erstwhile ‘Pappu,’ Rahul, must surely rank as the ultimate coup d’ grace administered by the right-wing’s very own Ram.              On a mundane level, if this new finding is testament to Modi’s fall from common approval, all chicaneries notwithstanding, it is simultaneously a tribute to the persistent application of mind and body that has characterised Rahul Gandhi’s politics, especially over the last grueling five years.

Even more subtly, the dethroning of Modi from the common man’s heart has come from a complete disenchantment with his elaborately constructed  sophistries and fake day-dreams sought to be sold as performance and caring.

Rahul’s rise has been the story of a dogged young idealist reaping the fruit of his refusal to deviate from the truth of things. Having suffered derision for long, from friend and foe alike, for his ostensible lack of tact in addressing the immediate moment, Rahul’s exemplary persistence in articulating issues that bear on the macro-ideological depths of what has been going wrong with India have palpably found space in the popular psyche of citizens, both among the rural masses and considerable sections of young urban Indians.

In this protracted and often frustrating process, the patchwork and rude cleverness of the Modi-led right-wing have finally come to be found out; and the realisation, even if late in coming, promises to return the soul of the republic to matters of substance and egalitarian probity.

An important part of Rahul’s learning over the taxing years has been that listening is of greater value than blabbing, and a transparently visible honesty of purpose and sharing are the most rewarding attributes of a democratic personality.

As everybody could see, Rahul’s interactions–and they have been many–with the media have contrasted  starkly with Modi’s desire to be heard  in perpetuity and not to be questioned, even by crony journalists.

There is an aspect of Rahul’s persona that bears comment of a different kind.

Much like the writer, he has seemed most at home in opposing excesses rather than taking on the onus of authority. This will of course sound blasphemous to many who accuse him of being at bottom the chief lord and master of the grand old party.

There comes a time when protagonists in public spaces must need to assume the onus.

To that point, as of the present moment, it will not but seem a cop-out should Rahul refuse to occupy the position of the Leader of the Opposition in parliament.

Concomitantly, nothing may prepare a young leader as soundly for a larger onus than a tough grind in the legislature, where homework and articulation must come together to form a fulcrum of influence  comparable with the office of the prime minister.

The nation will await Rahul Gandhi’s decision with interest.

This, now is a moment in the fraught history of the republic, especially over the last hurtfully brazen decade, when ordinary women and men who rejected  appeals both to sectarian identity and claims of divine entitlement, opting for  the common human need, will want to see if a new leadership emerges that is equipped to deliver that promise of common human need when in authority.

That reality makes the further shape of Rahul Gandhi’s career a matter of great national interest.

Caveat

Finally, a caveat that one hopes the young Gandhi will take in a positive spirit:

It may not have been politic to say what he said about a hypothetical Priyanka Gandhi Vadra vs Modi contest.

For  someone whom the party worker holds in high esteem, and for good reason, given that he has had the most to do with the resurgence of the Congress organisation, the wiser thing to do may have been to laud candidate Ajai Rai for very nearly getting the better of the great Modi.

That Rahul Gandhi is now four percentage points ahead of the ‘world’s  most popular leader’ in the all-important Uttar Pradesh suggests that he has crossed  a watershed Rubicon.

The thing to do is to keep  building on that merited advance.",Left
127,127,"""Blog Minister"" Jaitley Hiding BJP's ''Colossal Failures'': CongressCongress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala in a statement accused the BJP of being a ""hypocrite"". He alleged that the ""dynasty diversion"" by PM Modi and Arun Jaitley is aimed at drawing away the public's attention from issues of ""job crisis, rural distress and failed economy"".

Dubbing Mr Jaitley as a ""blog minister"", the Congress spokesperson said his ""incessant rants"" are being used by the Modi government to hide their failures -- unemployment, rural distress, mismanagement of economy and persecution of the weaker sections.

""PM Modi and Shri Arun Jaitley cannot hide behind daily blogs on non-issues in order to hide the real-issues,"" Mr Surjewala said.

""The latest outburst of Shri Arun Jaitley against the Congress party is an orchestrated PR gimmick and a cheap cover up exercise for the colossal failures of the past five years,"" he said.

Mr Jaitley, earlier on Sunday, took a swipe at the Congress leadership in a blog post titled ""Is the Congress Party Now Paying the Cost for its Dynastic Character?"".

""Dynastic parties"" succeed on the strength of some generations of the dynasty but sink with the others, the Union minister said in his post which came weeks before the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections beginning April 11.

""The Congress party has been out of power for five years. Its leaders and workers are accustomed to existing with the frills of office. They are staring at another defeat, and the seeming reason for this is the dynastic character of Congress party,"" Mr Jaitley said in a tweet.

Mr Surjewala said the Congress, with its 133-year-old rich history, does not require any certificates of approval from the likes of PM Modi and Jaitley on its contribution to nation building.

""... those who destroyed 4.7 crore jobs in last five years are preaching instead of introspecting,"" he said.

Showing ""a small mirror of truth"" to the BJP, Mr Surjewala cited examples of ""dynasts"" within the BJP. He named a number of such leaders whose fathers or elders held key positions in the BJP.

""Family background is not the guarantee for political success. It is the people who have the power to accept and reject in the political arena,"" the Congress spokesperson said.

""It is the people of India who have elected the Congress party time and again and shall vote the Congress party again to power in 2019 Lok Sabha elections,"" Mr Surjewala said.

""Five state elections which the BJP lost were just a trailer, people of India shall show them the film on 23rd May 2019,"" he added.

Mr Surjewala said India does not need a lecture ""from forces who sided with the British against the Indian people in the struggle for freedom during the national movement"".

The Indian delegation at the G7 summit as a special invitee of the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been handing out special gifts to 11 world leaders who are at the summit being held in the Bavarian Alps.

A majority of these gifts are part of Uttar Pradesh’s 'One District One Product' scheme which seeks to strengthen the traditional product of a district through training and sales avenues. Unusual products like ghunghroos from Etah have made a mark across the world under the scheme, while the already vast reach of chikankari embroidery has grown further.

Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was gifted black pottery products which can be made only from a kind of soil found in Nizamabad area of Azamgarh.

Boris Johnson, prime minister of the UK, received a hand painted tea set from Bulandshashr. The ceramic Khruja pottery dates back to the reign of King Feroz Shah Tuqhlaq.

French President Emmanuel Macron received bottles of Kannuaj’s famed ittr-oil based perfume, wrapped in gift boxes covered in the aari zardozi embroidery that the state’s capital Lucknow is known for.

A especially crafted table with marble inlay work from Agra was the gift for Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.

German Chancellor Scholz received a brass planter from Moradabad, known as India’s ‘brass city’.

The Senegalese President Macky Sall has been gifted baskets woven from monjh (a kind of grass that grows in abundance in arid areas) from Prayagraj and cotton rugs from Sitapur.

This is not the first time gifts from UP being given to world leaders. In September 2021, US Vice President Kamala Harris and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison were given gifts crafted out of gulabi meenakari. These gifts were of special significance as they were from Modi’s Lok Sabha constituency. Harris received a chess set while Morrison received a ship.

In 2018, during a meeting, the PM gifted a hand-made rug to the then Japanase PM Shinzo Abe.

In 2016, when PM Modi was in Iran, he had presented the Supreme Leader of Iran with specially commissioned reproduction of a rare seventh-century manuscript the Quran attributed to Hazrat Ali, the fourth caliph. Written in Kufic script, this manuscript is a prized possession of the ministry of culture’s Rampur Raza Library of Uttar Pradesh.

Minutes, instead, showed Fed officials were divided over what it would take for them to raise rates again. There was no suggestion of a cut., “The debate is still focused on whether to tighten or not, and not whether to cut,” said Wrightson ICAP LLC chief economist Lou Crandall. “The risk is tilted in the direction of more tightening.”, U.S. equity futures rose Thursday after stocks closed higher on Wednesday. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index slipped, though the euro gained after positive numbers from France. The European Central Bank will publish the account of its January meeting later, providing insight into policy makers’ thinking about the current slowdown in the euro area., Fed officials dedicated a large portion of their discussion to concerns over risks facing the U.S. economy, ranging from slower growth in China and Europe and waning fiscal stimulus, to ongoing trade disputes and the complications from the U.K. exit from the European Union. Due to those worries, several officials “nudged down their outlooks for output growth,” the minutes showed., The minutes also hammered home the point that officials would proceed cautiously. The record included a lengthy justification for being “patient” in deciding when and how next to adjust policy., Still, all the discussion of downside risks and patience didn’t shift the debate into the territory where cuts came into view. Pricing in federal funds futures indicate a small chance that the Fed’s next move will be a rate cut., “Several” policy makers indicated “if the economy evolved as they expected, they would view it as appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate later this year.”, That was balanced by another group of “several” officials who “argued that rate increases might prove necessary only if inflation outcomes were higher than in their baseline outlook.”, That left some economists convinced the minutes weren’t quite as dovish as the message seemingly delivered on Jan. 30, when the Fed dropped a longstanding reference in its statement to “further gradual increases” in rates, and replaced it with a promise to be patient in deciding the “timing and size of future adjustments.”, Asked whether the term “adjustments” signaled the Fed’s next move was just as likely to be a cut as a hike, Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters after the meeting that policy makers weren’t leaning strongly in either direction., The “minutes suggest that the committee is probably still modestly biased toward the next move being a tightening, whereas the statement conveyed more of a flat neutral bias,” Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a note to clients., That was echoed by Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc: “The minutes, in our view, indicate that the committee retains some upward bias in its policy rate path.”, On the balance sheet, the minutes said almost all officials agreed “it would be desirable to announce before too long a plan to stop reducing the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings later this year.”, Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton LLP, said she now expects the Fed will make that announcement in March., Fed officials expanded their balance sheet dramatically as an emergency measure to calm debt markets and stimulate the economy during the financial crisis. The portfolio has declined to about $4 trillion from a peak of $4.5 trillion in 2015., “They will have a permanently gigantic balance sheet,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies LLC. “They always said it would be larger than pre-crisis, but earlier commentary suggested it would something significantly smaller.”, ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Center
1695,1695,"India didn't get freedom only to be colonised by RSS ideology: Rahul Gandhi
Congress MP says BJP and PM Narendra Modi see only one nation, one language and one leader, a fundamental misunderstanding of India                                   Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday launched the second phase of his Lok Sabha election campaign in his home constituency of Wayanad in Kerala by attacking the ruling BJP and its ideological mentor RSS, saying India did not earn freedom from the British only to be colonised by the ideology of the Sangh Parivar.

Addressing party workers and voters in his constituency, the Wayanad MP also exuded confidence that the grand old party would come back to power both in the state and at the Centre.

He said the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi see only one nation, one language and one leader, and this is a fundamental misunderstanding of our country. India is like a bouquet of flowers and each one has to be respected because it promotes the beauty of the entire bouquet, he said. ""This idea that India should have only one leader is an insult to every single young Indian,"" he added.

Citing the example of language, he said it is not something that can be imposed, and that it comes from inside a person's heart. ""To tell a person from Kerala that your language is inferior to Hindi, for example, is an insult to the people of Kerala. It is like saying what is coming out of your heart is inferior to what is coming out of the heart of a person from Uttar Pradesh,"" he said.                      Gandhi said it was like looking at a bouquet of flowers and telling the red rose that we don't like you being red and we want you to be white. ""It is like telling a bouquet of flowers that we want every flower to be white,"" Gandhi said.

Stating that Malayalam is not just a language but a link to a civilisation, he said when a child is taught Malayalam, it is not only about the language. ""He is being taught the history of Kerala, the culture of Kerala, the affection and respect... that's what he is being taught,"" he said, adding that it is the same for history, culture and religion.

Gandhi also questioned the alleged ""one leader"" idea of the saffron party and asked why India could not have more leaders. ""Why can a young boy or a girl not be a leader? Why can't our brother who rides an autorickshaw be a leader? Why can't our policemen be a leader? Why just one leader? Why can't we have more leaders?"" he asked.

Gandhi also claimed that this line of thought was the main difference between the Congress and the BJP. The MP said the Congress wants to listen to the people of the country and love and respect their beliefs, language, religion, and culture. But the BJP wants to impose something from the top, he alleged.
""We did not get freedom from the British to be colonised by the ideology of the RSS. We want India to be ruled by all her people,"" he said.

This was Gandhi's second visit to Wayanad, from where he is seeking a second win, since the election dates were announced. Earlier in the day, he held a massive roadshow in town, sitting atop an open-roofed car. Hundreds of workers rallied beside him holding placards with his photo.

Listing out various local issues being faced by the people of Wayanad, Gandhi said human-animal conflict and the night travel ban are perplexing problems here, and the Congress was committed to resolving them.

""I have written multiple times about these issues to our chief minister and the Central government. And we will continue to put pressure on them. It is a complicated issue but we are going to resolve this issue with you,"" he said.

He also specially mentioned the Nilambur railway issue and said it would be easily resolved when the Congress comes to power in Delhi. ""The reality is because we are not in power in Delhi or Kerala, both governments are giving step-motherly treatment to Wayanad. And we are going to come to power at the Centre and in the state... this issue will be resolved,"" Gandhi added.

The Congress leader kicked off his campaign in Wayanad early this month by filing his nomination  papers and holding another road show. He won the Wayanad seat by a record margin of over 4.31 lakh votes during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Polling in Kerala's 20 Lok Sabha seats will be held on 26 April. The results will be out on 4 June.

886,886,"Ever since Prime Minister Modi has taken office, his political opponents as well as the mainstream media have tried to analyze, debate and punch holes in this claim of “minimum government, maximum governance”. Various interpretations have been made based on prejudices and the topic has also been debated based on Modi’s tenure in Gujarat as well as his statements during speeches. My expectations were also much different than how it is turning out in the first seven months of Modi regime. Governance is a long drawn process and I will hold my views on that. In the meantime, let us evaluate the ‘minimum government’ part of this claim.

My theoretical understanding of ‘minimum government’ included eliminating some departments, canceling some social programs, downsizing workforce in governmental agencies, privatization of PSUs, government ceding control in some bodies and so on. Mainstream media has been fixated with the number of ministers in the Central Cabinet as the critical parameter for minimum government. Opposition parties have been throwing darts at everything, thus making it difficult to know their interpretation. Also, they do not seem to suggest a concrete alternative to this idea by PM Modi.

Let us analyze how the ‘minimum government’ plan has been playing on the ground, based on decisions made by the government. Below are very few examples that have been highlighted in the media:

-One of the first decisions by Nirmala Sitaraman, Minister of State for Corporate Affairs, was to give a free hand to the companies regarding boiler inspection. This was an experiment done in Gujarat, which has been expanded to the national level–Government decided to annul the requirement of gazetted officers’ attestation on non-original documents. Thus putting faith in the common man who ownsthe documents, than the one who signs on them without verification (more often than not).

-Recently, Ministry of Railways decentralized tender process and the zonal managers can now manage the process at their level, without the minister’s interference.

-In the weekend’s ‘GyanSangam’ meeting with the bankers, PM Modi assured government’s hands-off approach in the internal workings of the Public Sector Banks (PSBs). Unlike in the past, any merger decision will be made by the Board than the Finance Minister.

Apart from these, there have been other initiatives which haven’t been included in the ‘minimum government’ debates. However, I think these also fall into this group:-Swachh Bharat Abhiyan(SBA): This has been an energetic initiative from the Modi government to improve cleanliness, thus reducing the reliance on Safaai Karmachaaris or our Municipal authorities in our daily lives. Apart from being a social cause, SBA has demonstrated the power of communities in implementing government programs. I will go as far as to say, SBA is a case study for “minimum government”. Apart from initiating the program with photo-ops, government has spent minimum from the exchequer. People have owned the program and are taking it forward. Needless to say, we are still long way from being a ‘Swachh Bharat’ to evaluate the success of the program. Though I am sure PM would have something up his sleeve to take it to the logical end. Till then, well begun is half done.

-Modernization of Railway stations: By inviting private players to spruce up the stations by offering services like hotels, shops, etc the government can focus on improving the train services. This would result in more optimal utilization of the space and giving more options to the passengers. When an airport can have these kinds of facilities, then why can’t a train passenger enjoy similar amenities? It’s unfortunate that this debate gets dragged into the usual privatization noise.

For us conservatives, there have been some negative surprises too. I fail to understand some decisions/non-decisions by the government:

-Absolutely nothing has been done with regards to privatization. We read reports of some roadshow intermittently. However, I don’t envisage any progress in this fiscal. I certainly hope that the Finance Minister is taking comfort in the fall in crude and commodity prices and has a long list of companies to offload to generate revenues in the next fiscal year.


-No decision has been forthcoming on the privatization of Air India. For how long will the governments keep feeding this baby? Neither service improves nor the finances – this is one baby that should be thrown out of the bathtub. There have been arguments that Air India has a social role too; like the ferrying of stranded Indians from Iraq, Libya, etc. I appreciate this concern. But wouldn’t it be cheaper to rent flights for these special missions? Or having only a small fleet of aircrafts on standby for these kinds of situations?

– Also, I have been disappointed that free-loading programs like MNREGA, subsidized Hajj trip, etc have not been eliminated. Yes, there are cutting around the edges. But, when will the government show its might? If a Congress led ‘coalition’ can introduce so many social programs, why can’t a government with ‘absolute majority’ revoke a few? (read postscript)

– Recently, the government decided to pump in 60Cr into IFCI Ltd to make it a government company. I fail to understand the reasoning behind this decision. What can an IFCI do that an IDFC or an ICICI cannot?

At this early stage of Modi era, there have been more hits than misses. I hope the only excuse for the misses is the lack of time. That would reassure conservatives that there is more to come. With the government’s focus on helping entrepreneurs, I hope there are some path breaking initiatives like no taxes till first 5 or 10 employees. Just imagine the impetus that would give to the new graduates to explore new avenues. However, let us start with just one page form to start a new company – thereby preventing running around offices before generating the first Rupee as revenue. Wouldn’t that be a great advertisement for ‘minimum government’?

Postscript: I get the point that passing legislations needs a big tent approach. I also appreciate PM Modi’s effort to build consensus for passing these legislations. I would just quote what former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had said: “To me, consensus seems to be the process of abandoning all beliefs, principles, values and policies. So it is something in which no one believes and to which no one objects.” (Speech at Monash University, 10/6/81)”. My fear is, in the hope of satisfying those who inherently hate you, you may end up losing your core voters. Hope PM Modi understands that one cannot wake up a group that’s pretending to be asleep.",Right

1468,1468,"The battle for Internet’s freedom is not new and is certainly far from over. The reason most people seem to protect this right so dearly, is because the internet has, in more ways than one, become the last bastion of true democracy. A free space where everyone has the luxury of surviving. A space where thoughts are free to be expressed, heard, absorbed or discarded. But, bit by bit, that freedom is being chipped away. Sometimes by governments, and sometimes by a tiny coterie that believes that freedom should be their right, and not the other’s, whose ideology they don’t subscribe to. After Smriti Irani’s announcement that she might be contemplating to constitute a committee that would look into the code of ethics to be followed by digital platforms, many were extremely uncomfortable, and with good reason. Any stick to control freedom, that is handed over to the government, will be misused sooner or later. It is like the age-old ‘surveillance state’ debate. Many choose to believe that if they haven’t done something wrong, they would ideally have nothing to fear, but they fail to realise that they have nothing to fear only till there is a government in power that chooses to uphold freedom as a fundamental right. As is the nature of democracy, governments change and it is unlikely that one can predict precisely how a certain government in the future would use the stick handed to them. It is this argument I use to oppose the possession of any thought control tool in the hands of the government as an institution, and that is independent of which political party might form the government at that given point of time. Having said that, the problem with most such crusades to uphold freedom, is that it mostly begins when firstly, the protesting party doesn’t particularly like the government in power at that moment, and, to secure freedom for ‘their people’, not uphold the basic principle of freedom. I personally got a glimpse into how such selective crusades work during a recent incident when 100 ’eminent people’ signed a letter to Smriti Irani opposing the proposal to regulate digital media. I was asked for my number by a young journalist to be added in this group, to deliberate the way forward. I was never included and was later informed by the same gentleman that while some did want OpIndia’s representation there, some didn’t. The result was evident. The letter had no representation of the right leaning portals. Essentially, an important issue was reduced to a “anti Modi brigade writes to Smriti Irani” trope because the mafia like, illiberal mentality of the left prevents them from engaging with anyone who doesn’t conform to their worldview. To be fair, some reached out to me after this information was made public with wildly cock and bull stories. One said, “the WhatsApp group was open and anyone could just click on an invite link and join”. I didn’t get any link. The very people who talk about democratization ganged up to keep inconvenient voices out. No cause can be championed when hypocrisy is used as a shield from behind the veils of virtue. OpIndia was excluded because its ideological leaning didn’t bode well with the harbingers of neutrality and that is something that mustn’t be lost sight of. Most of the signatories have no right to speak of freedom when they were celebrating the PostCard.news editor being arrested and thrown in jail for what he had written. And if one must celebrate his arrest, one must also demand that members of the coterie be arrested for similar crimes. That the latter didn’t happen, makes me believe that the moment a government of their choosing comes to power, these beacons of virtue will be more than happy to allow regulation that can then be used to shut down opposing voices. When the ‘fake news’ debate was raging, I recall Pratik Sinha from Alt News harping about how “fake news” is generated by the “right wing” and how a veteran journalist like Pallavi Ghosh can’t be held accountable for her communally charged fake news of a woman getting gang raped for eating beef, because it didn’t get too many retweets. With such asinine and reprehensible reasoning, these elements, this ilk, cannot be trusted to debate rationally and arrive at an amiable and acceptable solution to uphold freedom. The very coterie that today talks of freedom to oppose and freedom to offend have shut out every right leaning voice as “fake news”. Most of the times, they provide no proof but bark off platitudes to create a narrative against the ‘unwashed masses’ encroaching upon an industry that had been monopolised by homogeneously left voices for the longest time. It is thus amusing that they would scream so shrill when Smriti Irani makes a suggestion. Evidently, arrests of opposing voices is more acceptable to them than an ideologically different government giving them suggestions. This incident points towards a deeper malaise and while I don’t support any government’s attempts to regulate or control the internet and its portals, I will put forth my own reasons for the same without subscribing to the points forwarded by the ‘100 signatories’ as evidently, their reasons and crusade (at least for some of them who wanted OpInda excluded) are coloured by political leanings and ideological motivations. Digital platforms have given writers an extremely freeing experience and is full of citizen’s journalists who write because they want the truth, or their version of it, to be known to the readers without censorship of any kind. Such platforms have grown by leaps and bounds influencing national discourse, political discourse and even voting patter, albeit, to a marginal level. One has to understand that digital platforms and citizen journalists don’t have the right or the status of conventional journalists. So I, for example, can’t have a ‘Press’ sticker stuck on the back of my car and report incidents like journalists can. And when I don’t have the rights of the press, it is unthinkable the ethics I must follow, be governed by representatives of the PCI and NBA (as a part of the committee), as proposed by the minister. I speak as the Editor of OpIndia when I say that our platform itself believes that majority media houses have lost their ethical code. We have over 300 articles filed under “Media lies”. To ask us then, to conform to the ethical standards set by the very institution we oppose is a monstrosity at myriad levels. One has to also be honest about the nature of digital portals. If you pierce the veils of neutrality, one realises that every digital portal has a pronounced ideological slant that in turn percolates into a political preference. I have no qualms in accepting that we have an ideologically right slant and that makes us more predisposed to supporting BJP. I also have no qualms in stating that other portals like The Wire, Scroll, Caravan, HuffPost, NewsLaundry, TheNewsMinute, The Print, Alt News etc have a left leaning and are thus more predisposed to supporting Congress or the Left over BJP. These are truths one must accept in order to have a rational debate on the subject. With such ideological slant and by default, political preferences, any government with a regulation stick that can easily turn into a tool of censorship is dangerous. We saw the repercussions with the draconian 66A law and how it was used to shut down voices that opposed the Congress government. What is to say that if the digital platform is regularised today, it won’t be censored tomorrow? I don’t yet doubt that the Minister has no intention of imposing censorship, but is there a possibility that it could happen if not today then sometime in the future? Yes. To support or oppose tools in the hand of the government depending on which political party is in power is an exceptionally narrow word view that doesn’t help anyone. Having said that, with the growing power of digital platforms to influence discourse and the kind of blind money which is being pumped into this industry even by means of FDI (Omidyar, for example), I do believe regulations to the extent of making financial interests and funding open for scrutiny is essential. Any regulation beyond the financial realm, that delves into Editorial content will eventually become draconian. The moment you censor thoughts, you kill the soul of a man and the spirit of the writer. I oppose any regulation that may just as easily morph into tools of censorship. The tragic comedy here is that I would have signed that letter if I wasn’t kept out because of my political leaning and ideology by the harbingers of neutrality.",Right

1405,1405,"Terrorism takes root in or is drawn to regions where religious or political freedom is threatened or afflicted by insensitive governance and a lack of fair play by the local government in power. It can also be craftily fostered by enemy nations inimical to one’s progress and peace. In its offensive avatar, it thrives on the elements of surprise, shifting of strategies and tactics—adoption primarily of all machinations to keep one step ahead of the opposing establishment’s counter-terror machinery. That the terrorist usually has the initiative to strike at a place and time of his own choosing makes the task of the counter terrorist forces all the more difficult. The grievously violent Partition of India in August 1947 brought forth countless contentious problems for the two newly born nations, India and Pakistan. Among these tribulations which have persisted since the last 75 years and led to four wars has been Jammu and Kashmir which also gravely impacts the relationship existing between both nations. That Pakistan conveniently forgets that the entire state of J&K had legally acceded to the Union of India on 27 Oct 1947— a reality which Pakistan refuses to acknowledge and persists with its myopic anti-India agendas and a fatal obsession for J&K. Pakistan, currently undergoing its worst near- starvation economic state and growing political instability still refuses to change tack to mend its relations with India for its own good. Pakistan’s unabashed support of terror activities in J&K is a universally accepted fact. In the Indian border state of J&K, Pakistan sponsored terrorism and militancy had raised its ugly head in 1989—90. It spread all over the state albeit primarily in the Kashmir Valley region with its intensity and reach varying in keeping with the ups and downs of the ever-restive political relationship between India and Pakistan. From a raging militancy spearheaded by a well-crafted Pakistan’s Gen Zia-ul-Haq’s strategy of “bleeding India by a thousand cuts” and occasional cries of even “azaadi” (freedom), over the last 20 years, militancy in J&K has rapidly and distinctly declined all over the state. The worst districts during the nineties and this century’s initial years, plagued by the curse of terror in J&K, were in the region North of the Pir Panjal especially in the Srinagar Valley. Barring a few isolated terror incidents, South of the Pir Panjal, namely the Uri-Poonch-Rajouri-Naushera region, the Valley’s demography and religious poison infused in this area by Pakistan infiltrated terrorists from across the border assisted the growth of terror activities in the entire J&K. Overall, employing a mixture of fundamentalism, the political ambitions of certain leaders in J&K, information warfare and Delhi’s reluctance to firmness in its dealings with separatist leadership, Pakistan did manage to give teeth to its false narratives of J&K’s unrest within the Union of India. However, though the bulk of terror Pak engineered terror activities in J&K were predominantly in the North of Pir Panjal region, which is largely Muslim, in the last few months, in particular, terror activities have also erupted in the areas south of Pir Panjal region after a lapse of time. This region is comparatively more forested, hilly and villages located far from each other. The thick forests and the many caves in its mountains makes this region relatively easier for terrorists to select suitable hideouts and equally difficult for security forces to search for them and flush them out. Pakistani terrorists from across the IB / Line of Control with some limited logistical support from their Overground Workers (OGW) have been busy, especially in the last few months, to commence trouble afresh in J&K but not to much avail. However, there has been much concern within India of these foreign terrorists re-igniting terror in different ways in some parts of India which today are totally terror-incidents free. Without going too much into infructuous terrorism related data, events of the very recent past, terror related, is a good pointer for ascertaining the actual ground situation especially after the Centre withdrew Article 370 from the state in Aug 2021. It is more than necessary that the terror related factual ground situation in J&K is known to all as wrongly it is being spread that terror activities, in the last three years or so, are on the rise. In actual fact they are on the decline and there is no surge in terror activities in J&K. Four terror incidents did occur between 9 to 12 June 2024 south of the Pir Panjal region with a total of 11 fatalities triggering fresh concerns. Way back in 2001 when terrorism was at its peak in J&K, there were 4021 fatalities whereas in 2024, till a week back, there have been 32 fatalities—in the same period in 2023 there were 39 casualties. Overall, fatalities till 2017 were on an average 1000 per year. The total numbers have come down drastically even though the occurrence of terror related attacks remains high and thus no laxity in vigilance and security preparedness should ever happen. Pakistan’s notorious Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) which is the fulcrum of Pakistan’s terror operations conducted synergistically by its deep state—-the unholy trinity of the Pak Army, intelligence agencies and the many terrors Tanzeem’s it supports and funds—each year gets hyperactive before the commencement of the Amarnath Yatra. The Yatra commences on June 29 and is an important annual feature for the state. The Reasi attack on June 9, 2024, by terrorists on the bus carrying pilgrims from the Shiv Khori temple back to Katra which led to 9 fatalities and 41 injured was indeed a cowardly attack by Pakistani terrorists and a warning from them for pilgrims intending to visit the Amarnath shrine for the annual yatra. Attacking innocent pilgrims by these Pakistani origin terrorists are indeed a most cowardly act and they should be ashamed of themselves and the values they represent. Indian security forces will have to put their best foot forward collectively to defeat the evil intentions of these terrorists to disrupt the Amarnath Yatra. It is worth noting that in the past too, Indian pilgrims trekking or going up by horses to the shrine have been targeted and fatalities have occurred. Thus, ensuring a peaceful, casualties free Yatra remains a formidable challenge for India’s security forces. At an appropriate level, Pakistan has to be suitably informed that J&K’s accession to India is irrevocable, Article 370’s removal done and dusted and if they need to mend relations with India there can be no compromise on these basic issues. If Pakistan persists in continuing with terrorism then it better be ready to face India’s wrath as recently PM Narendra Modi has warned regarding unleashing of the “full spectrum of India’s counter terror capability.” Meanwhile, all steps must be taken to emotionally and economically fully integrate all Kashmiris into the national mainstream. In addition, India, without making noises, must discreetly and realistically ponder over steps which can be taken to get Gilgit-BaltistanGB) and Pakistan Occupied Jammu and Kashmir areas into India as our parliament had ordained in Feb 1994. Though India does not wish for any kinetic conflicts with Pakistan, the latter’s low intensity conflict has to be dealt with the robustness it demands. Full Statehood must be restored to J&K as soon as possible and its carving into regional entities was never a desirable step. We have to work towards restoration of the same geographical expanse as we inherited on 27 Oct 1947 from Maharaja Hari Singh—-that also includes GB and POK. Meanwhile India must accord adequate efforts towards perception management for the locals, also those of the populace in POJK and GB to know about the realities in all spheres in our part of J&K. Leading Muslim scholars from other parts of the country must visit Islamic shrines in J&K and educate all concerned as to the closeness of ‘Kashmiriyat’ with the secular and civilized values of the Indian state rather than the self-defeating fundamentalist values of Pakistan. Elections to the State Assembly must be held as directed by the Supreme Court and not postponed for any reason. That some Pak inspired OGWs, and foreign terrorists may try to create hindrances should be factored in by our security establishment. Notwithstanding any security problems, the Centre must ensure economic resurgence of the state and encourage a maximum number of industrialists to invest/ set up plants in the state—off course their security will have to be ensured by the parent nation. Overall , in its Kashmir policy, India now must redouble its efforts to graduate from conflict management to conflict resolution. A long term strategy encompassing all aspects of human endeavour and criss-crossing various domains must be conceived and implemented without political prejudices. J&K embellishes the core of Indian nationalism, secularism and the inclusive and plural values which symbolize India and thus no effort can ever be spared to ensure India’s crown jewel to glitter to the maximum.",Right
306,306,"(Bloomberg) -- When Zimbabweans celebrated after the military toppled Robert Mugabe in late 2017, few could have foreseen that just over a year later their economy would be collapsing and soldiers would be on the streets., It’s a scenario that’s played out all too often when a strongman who has ruled for decades leaves the stage., For almost all of Mugabe’s nearly four decades in charge, his decisions were unquestioned, and his ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front’s grip on power rarely wavered. By replacing him with Emmerson Mnangagwa, the military won a factional battle within ZANU-PF, weakening it, and sidelined the once-powerful police force and secret service that were key Mugabe allies., “The glue it had in the past 38 years, that cohesive, forced consensus under Mugabe -- it’s gone,” Tendai Biti, a senior leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, said in an interview in Johannesburg., What’s happening today in Zimbabwe echoes the experiences of other African countries and bears similarities with the chaos currently taking place in Venezuela, six years after the death of Hugo Chavez., In Ivory Coast, Felix Houphouet-Boigny’s 1993 death in office triggered a power struggle over succession and ultimately a civil war that divided the country in two for almost a decade. Somalia hasn’t been a functioning state since Siad Barre was toppled in 1991, and in Congo the overthrow of Mobutu Sese Seko after 32 years in power sparked the world’s most deadly conflict since World War II. In Burkina Faso, the intelligence services fell apart with the ousting of strongman Blaise Compaore, making the country a target of jihadist attacks., To be sure, there are political differences between West and southern Africa. In the south of the continent most countries, including Zimbabwe, are governed by parties formed during the liberation struggle against white rule. In West Africa, power is often concentrated in the hands of one dominant character who maintains control by weakening state institutions, making those nations even more vulnerable to disruption when they’re gone., “There’s usually one conductor playing the orchestra,” Vincent Foucher, a research fellow at the National Center for Scientific Research in Bordeaux, said of West Africa. “Once the leader is out, his political party is completely weakened because there is no ideology that keeps it together.”, In addition to the West and central African nations that have fallen apart following the departure of long-term leaders, others may follow., Paul Biya has been in charge of Cameroon for almost 37 years and the country is riven by a separatist insurgency that’s left the ruling elite increasingly divided. Politicians in Gabon are jockeying for power in the absence of President Ali Bongo, who suffered a stroke in October last year and has been recovering in Morocco. In Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang Nguema has presided over a kleptocracy since 1979., For Zimbabwe the outlook is dire. A currency shortage means it can’t afford essential imports, inflation is at its highest since 2008, factories are closing and protests over a more than doubling of fuel prices last month were crushed, with at least 17 people killed. Teachers were intimidated by the military in a subsequent strike and soldiers are a common sight in buses, gas stations and supermarkets., “There have been several confirmed reports of extra-judicial killings, allegations of rape and torture,” said Fadzayi Mahere, a lawyer who ran as an independent in last year’s elections. “The military seems to want its pound of flesh for its role in removing Mugabe.”, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube says the government is moving as quickly as possible to revive the economy. Nick Mangwana, Zimbabwe’s secretary for information, said that since Mugabe’s exit media freedom has improved and cabinet has approved the rescinding of a much maligned act that hindered reporting on the government., “With the situation we inherited, it was also going to be a tough struggle,” Ncube said in a statement. “The process of restructuring, reforming and rebuilding our economy is just beginning. But the train has left the station and we are moving firmly in the right direction.”, Even so the situation is complicated by the tensions between the police and the army, open divisions within the ruling party and rumors of strains between Mnangagwa and his deputy and former armed forces commander, Constantino Chiwenga. Mnangagwa retired four generals this week while Chiwenga was hospitalized abroad for an undisclosed ailment, in what has been seen as an attempt to boost his hold over the military., Yet the ruling party is unlikely to be dislodged easily. Mnangagwa is a former spy chief who takes pride in his nickname the “crocodile,” with his office sporting a mug themed on the reptile., “Zimbabwe has a long tradition of political violence, and Emmerson Mnangagwa is a very, very old crocodile who’s always been at the center of that,” Foucher said. “Even though Mnangagwa has presented himself as a moderate, it’s clear that he wants to hold on to power.”, That hasn’t eased the chaos. Communications officials often contradict each other, and Mnangagwa has twice condemned violence by his own military., “You don’t have evidence that this is a government that can actually make decisions, whereas under Mugabe you had no doubt who was in charge,” Biti said. “It’s a fragility that I’ve not seen before. The state is in a permanent state of paranoia. That’s why they are putting soldiers on the street picking up people.”, ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Center
273,273,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin said honest business people shouldn’t have to live under “constant fear of criminal prosecution,” days after the arrest of one of the country’s top foreign investors., Echoing previous exhortations to officials and law-enforcement to stop harassing business, which have produced few results, Putin said Wednesday in his annual state-of-the-nation address that “detention is often extended without good reason” and almost half of cases “don’t even make it to court.”, But he didn’t mention Baring Vostok Capital Partners Founder Michael Calvey, the American private equity investor who’s in pre-trial detention as the latest prominent business figure to face prosecution. While senior officials and bankers in Russia have urged Calvey’s release, Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Monday the Kremlin doesn’t believe the case will ,  Russia’s investment climate, though it’s following events closely., A Moscow court last week ordered Calvey and three colleagues held in detention until April on charges related to fraud at retail lender Vostochny Express Bank, where Baring Vostok is the biggest shareholder. They deny wrongdoing and the veteran investor says the case is related to an ongoing dispute with Artem Avetisyan, the other big shareholder in the bank., Putin’s latest proposed solution may not be of much help to Calvey -- he suggested setting up a “special digital platform” where entrepreneurs can report threats to their businesses. The platform idea was initially put forward by the Agency for Strategic Initiatives, a Kremlin-backed policy think tank that counts Avetisyan among its senior management., ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Center
1120,1120,"Dairy farming in India faces unique challenges during the monsoon season, affecting both animal health and productivity. The increased moisture and environmental changes brought by the rains create conditions that can significantly impact the wellbeing of dairy animals and the efficiency of farming operations. Bhupendra Suri, CEO, Godrej Jersey outlines the key challenges faced by dairy farmers during the rainy season and provides preventive measures to mitigate these issues.

During the monsoon season, dairy animals face twice the risk of exposure to various viruses, bacteria, and infections compared to other seasons. o The increased moisture in the air creates a conducive environment for harmful microorganisms to flourish, leading to the spread of numerous diseases. o Waterlogging in dairy farms, caused by poor drainage and leaky sheds, creates unhygienic environment that increases the risk of waterborne diseases, which, along with other weather-related conditions, are linked to diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease, Haemorrhagic septicemia and Anthrax.

Dairy farming productivity typically decreases by 10-15% due to heavy rains. o The reduction in productivity typically translates to a loss of 1-3 liters per animal per day. o Unhygienic conditions causes the flare up of organisms causing mastitis that affect milk production and cause huge economic losses to the dairy industry. At national level, it causes an annual loss of ₹12,000 crores.

Excessive moisture during the monsoon promotes the growth of moulds in the feed, which, if consumed, can be harmful to the health of the cattle. o The green fodder available during the monsoon is lush and contains a higher water content. Solely feeding this type of fodder can sometimes result in the cattle voiding watery dung. o The resulted reduced feed intake and grazing areas aggravates the problems for Livestocks.

Clean Milk Production Practices · Thoroughly clean and disinfect cattle sheds regularly. · Construct scientifically designed dung pits to manage waste effectively. · Implement and follow scientific milking practices to ensure hygiene. · Use fogging and disinfection to control ectoparasites, which can carry infectious agents.

mplement comprehensive deworming program before, during, and after monsoon. · Target common infestations like liver fluke, lungworm, tapeworm, and roundworm. · Consult with veterinarians for appropriate deworming schedules. · Godrej Jersey recognizes the importance of deworming and extends its support to farmers in multiple states such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu through its veterinary services to ensure the health and productivity of dairy animals.",Center
438,438," President Joe Biden said a $28.6 billion program that gives grants to restaurants hit by the pandemic shows how his administration is quickly making use of a rescue plan he signed into law in March., Since the government started accepting applications for the program this week, about 186,200 business already have applied, Biden said at the White House on Wednesday., “We’re putting the American Rescue Plan to work quickly and effectively,” Biden said Wednesday at the White House., Restaurants are among the businesses hardest hit by Covid-19 lockdowns and restrictions, as states forced many to temporarily close, curtail hours and reduce seating., Under the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief measure Biden signed in March, restaurants can apply for grants ranging from $1,000 to $5 million per location, or $10 million for those with 20 or fewer locations., “We want to make sure that our restaurants, bars and other dining establishments can staff back up, and they can come back as well,” Biden said. He called restaurants “the gateway to opportunity” for many families., The Small Business Administration began accepting grant applications on Monday and will continue until the money is fully spent. For the first three weeks, preference will be given to applicants that are majority owned by women, veterans or “disadvantaged” individuals., Earlier in the day, Biden visited Las Gemelas, a restaurant in Northeast Washington owned in part by Mexican immigrants to highlight the grant program., According to the White House, the restaurant had to cut its staffing to 7 from 55 during the pandemic, but was able to rehire employees and provide back pay to those who returned through the Paycheck Protection Program., The National Restaurant Association is already concerned about the money running out., “The question on the minds of many is what happens when applications outpace the available funds,” Tom Bene, the association’s chief executive officer, said in a Monday statement. “Restaurants are operating in an uncertain environment, with continued needs to restore customer confidence in their safety and to bring workers back into the economy.”, ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center
879,879,"When Narendra Modi refused to wear a skullcap in September 2011, it raised many eyebrows and invited many deductive theories. Most of the outraging individuals and organizations were those who don’t miss to waive the flag of secularism in such situations.

Surprisingly, these people were also the same people who stand for freedom of choice and find it utterly suppressive when girls/women are prescribed dress codes. However, they didn’t wait a minute to suggest a dress code for Modi.

What these people ended up doing is reducing Muslims to a skullcap. They totally ignored the fact that Modi did accept a green shawl that had Islamic texts written on it. For them, skullcap signified Muslims.

It didn’t stop here. Their skull-cap deductive theory moved to another level when Modi was seen wearing donning headgears, turbans, or tribal Dumluks. Modi, in an interview, said that he can’t wear skullcap to appease people. Even though some of the Muslim clerics defended Modi’s choice, the secular brigade kept criticizing Modi and kept reducing Muslims to mere skullcaps.Again, they totally ignored the fact that Modi, in almost all of his election rallies, kept on telling people that Hindu or Muslims were not enemies of each other, but the common enemy of both Hindus and Muslims was poverty and corruption.

This secular-liberal obsession with religious attire was reflected even in Media, which is controlled by left-liberal narrative. Media started counting skullcaps and burqa in political rallies. Conspiracy theories and politics were drawn from these data. They didn’t realize that by doing so, they were stereotyping Muslims as skullcap wearing and burqa wearing.This obsession with attire and linking it to Modi has again come to fore today when secular-liberal crowd is making an issue of Gujarat police organizing an anti-terror drill, where a person wearing skullcap was playing the role of a terrorists. While this is something the government could have avoided, once again by outraging against this incident, people are reducing the Muslim community to a skullcap.Yes, we can’t equate a film producer with police force (although the police claims that they use all kinds of attire, and media chose to highlight only when it was turn of skullcap). While police force could avoid taking steps that may stereotype a community, liberals are doing everything to strengthen that skullcap stereotype.

It is to be noted that in 2012, under the governance of UPA, anti-hijacking mock drill a similar mock drill was conducted at the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport, where persons playing the role of terrorists were wearing skullcaps. A small section of religious leaders among Muslims had chose to protest it, but the secular-liberal crowd didn’t protest. Perhaps they understood that this will reduce Muslims to mere skullcaps.

But what happens to them when Modi could even remotely be linked to such an incident? They may think that by outraging on such issues they are making sure that Modi is reduced to anti-Muslim bigot, but in reality they are reducing Muslims to skullcaps and themselves to hypocrites.

Synopsis
AAP sources said if Congress wants alliance only in Delhi then it has to be in the 5:2 ratio and if an alliance is sealed for both Delhi and Haryana then the ratio can be 4:3 in the national capital and 6:3:1 in Haryana.
The Congress has offered the AAP a 4:3 seat-sharing formula - four Lok Sabha seats for the ruling party and three for itself while the AAP has proposed 5:2 ratio( five for itself and two for the grand old party).
The AAP is digging in its heels on the issue of alliance and is not ready to give more than two seats in Delhi to the Congress if the alliance is limited to the national capital, sources said. A meeting was held at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal 's residence on Tuesday and was attended by senior party leaders of Manish Sisodia, Gopal Rai, Sanjay Singh and Satyendra Kumar Jain.
Following the meeting, the party said it is ready to have further discussion with Congress and has appointed a representative to take the matter forward. AAP has appointed Singh to hold alliance talks with Congress but no representative has been hired by Congress yet.
AAP sources said if Congress wants alliance only in Delhi then it has to be in the 5:2 ratio and if an alliance is sealed for both Delhi and Haryana then the ratio can be 4:3 in the national capital and 6:3:1 in Haryana.
In the 6:3:1 ratio, Congress would contest six seats, Jannayak Janata Party three seats while AAP one seat, the sources said.
""The talks of alliance between AAP and Congress are presently stalled,"" the sources said.
""Alliance talks cannot be carried out on Twitter. It has to be discussed properly between the two parties and for that we have appointed our representative,"" said AAP's Rai.
""It was decided (in the meeting) that we would convince Congress that contesting together on 18 seats of Delhi, Haryana and Chandigarh would mean a definite loss for BJP,"" Rai added.
Kejriwal has clearly said that the Modi-Shah duo ""is a danger for the country and till the end, we will try to stop it,"" Singh told reporters after the meeting.
""An alliance with Congress would send the message that Modi would not be becoming the prime minister again,"" he added.
Amid a continuing blame game over seat-sharing in Delhi, Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal Monday engaged in a public spat, with the Congress president accusing the AAP of making a ""U-turn"" over alliance talks, prompting the Delhi chief minister to hit back at him.
Gandhi had said while the doors of his party are open, time is running out, but Kejriwal slammed him, questioning what U-turn was he talking about as the talks were still on.
The Congress has offered the AAP a 4:3 seat-sharing formula - four Lok Sabha seats for the ruling party and three for itself while the AAP has proposed 5:2 ratio( five for itself and two for the grand old party).
The Congress said its proposal is based of the vote share of both parties in 2017 civic polls here.
The Congress has accused the Kejriwal-led outfit of backing out on its commitment, as it is demanding seats in Goa, Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh, besides Delhi for a pre-poll understanding with the Congress.
In response to Gandhi's tweet, AAP's Singh said, ""Congress is not giving even a single seat to AAP in Punjab where it has four MPs and 20 MLAs and in Haryana.""
""In Delhi, where the Congress has zero MPs and MLAs, it is demanding three seats. Is this how agreement happens? Why do not you want to stop the BJP in other states,"" he asked.
The AAP has announced its candidates on the seven parliamentary constituencies in Delhi, while the Congress has finalised names of its candidates which could be announced soon.
Meanwhile on Tuesday, AAP said its Lok Sabha candidates would file their nominations from Thursday.
Rai said the party's west Delhi candidate Balbir Singh Jakhar would file his nomination on Thursday while Chandni Chowk candidate Pankaj Gupta, East Delhi candidate Atishi and North West Delhi candidate Gugan Singh would file their nominations on Saturday.
On Monday, South Delhi candidate Raghav Chadha, North East candidate Dilip Pandey and New Delhi candidate Brajesh Goel would file their nomination, Rai said.

India ,  Pakistan’s main spy agency was linked to a deadly suicide car bombing that killed 40 members of the security forces in the disputed region of Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan claim in full., Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, who hosted the Saudi royal earlier this week, denied that his country played any role in the attack claimed by the Pakistan-based group Jaish-e-Mohammed and said his military would retaliate if India launched any military response., Prince Mohammed, who announced his trip before the Kashmir strike on Feb. 14, has embarked on a diplomatic tour of Asia that will eventually take him to China to meet President Xi Jinping. But in South Asia, he has walked straight into the middle of a tense dispute between the nuclear-armed rivals -- both of whom went out of their way to show the prince a lavish welcome.

1584,1584,"Nitish Kumar, Bihar’s Chief Minister, continues his relentless campaign for special category status. Despite recent setbacks, Nitish remains determined to secure this designation, which he sees as vital for Bihar’s progress.

Central Government’s Position
On Monday, the Centre dealt a blow to Nitish’s aspirations by rejecting Bihar’s bid for special category status. This decision came even after the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ally’s repeated requests following the Lok Sabha Election results.Pankaj Chaudhary, Minister of State for Finance, clarified the government’s stance in a Lok Sabha reply. He explained that special category status was previously granted by the National Development Council (NDC) based on specific criteria.

Nitish’s Perspective
Nitish has been advocating for special status since Jharkhand’s separation from Bihar in 2000. He argues that Bihar’s unique challenges warrant this consideration.

Key points supporting Nitish’s demand:
– Bihar’s low per-capita GDP of about Rs 54,000
– The state’s ranking as India’s poorest according to the Centre’s Multi-dimensional Poverty Index
– Approximately 52% of Bihar’s population lacks proper access to basic necessities

Historical Context
The concept of Special Category Status emerged in 1969 during a National Development Council meeting. It aimed to provide extra support to disadvantaged states through increased central assistance and tax breaks.

Policy Changes and Current Scenario
The 14th Finance Commission’s recommendations in 2015 led to significant changes:
– Removal of distinctions between General and Special Category States
– Increase in states’ share of net shareable taxes from 32% to 42%

Currently, no new states are being granted Special Category Status, as the Indian Constitution doesn’t provide for such categorization.

Nitish’s Ongoing Efforts
Despite obstacles, Nitish persists in his advocacy for Bihar’s special status. He highlights the state’s unique challenges and potential benefits:
– Additional funding of about Rs 2.5 lakh crore for welfare measures
– Improved infrastructure and economic growth
– Enhanced support for Bihar’s 94 lakh poor families

Why Bihar Needs Special Status: Nitish’s Argument
1. Historical disadvantage: The separation of mineral-rich Jharkhand in 2000 left Bihar economically vulnerable.

2. High poverty rates: Bihar consistently ranks among India’s poorest states, with widespread poverty and underdevelopment.

3. Infrastructure gaps: The state lags in critical infrastructure, hindering economic growth and job creation.

4. Limited resources: Bihar’s current financial situation makes it challenging to fund large-scale development projects.

5. Population pressure: A high population density strains existing resources and services.

Opposition’s Stance
The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supports Nitish’s demand. RJD leader Manoj Kumar Jha stated that Bihar seeks both special category status and a special package. He emphasized that this demand has persisted since Bihar’s division.

Reasons for Rejection
The Centre cited several factors for denying Bihar’s request:

1. Existing criteria: Bihar doesn’t meet all the established NDC criteria for special status.

2. Previous assessments: An Inter-Ministerial Group in 2012 concluded that Bihar didn’t qualify based on NDC criteria.

3. Policy changes: The 14th Finance Commission’s recommendations altered the framework for state categorization.

4. Constitutional limitations: The Indian Constitution doesn’t explicitly provide for special category status.

The Road Ahead for Nitish and Bihar
While the central government maintains its position, Nitish’s determination remains unshaken. His quest for special category status highlights the complex interplay between state aspirations and national policy considerations. As Bihar grapples with economic challenges, Nitish’s advocacy underscores the ongoing debate about equitable development across India’s diverse states.

Nitish faces a challenging path ahead. He must balance his alliance commitments with his state’s developmental needs. The coming months may see Nitish exploring alternative strategies to secure additional support for Bihar, even as he continues to press for special status.

Conclusion
Nitish Kumar’s campaign for Bihar’s special status represents a critical juncture in the state’s development journey. While the immediate prospects seem dim, Nitish’s persistence reflects the urgency of addressing Bihar’s developmental challenges. As the debate continues, finding innovative solutions to support Bihar’s growth while maintaining national policy consistency remains a key challenge for both state and central leadership.",Center
815,815,"India’s farmers will call off a long-running protest after the government concedes to a clutch of pending demands, including assurances to consider guaranteed prices for all produce, not just rice and wheat, union leaders have said. “We have decided to call off the protest as most of our demands have been accepted by the government,” Jagmohan Singh of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Indian Farmers Union), who attended a meeting of farmer unions on Thursday, told Al Jazeera. Tens of thousands of farmers had staged the year-long protest to persuade Prime Minister Narendra Modi to repeal three new laws passed in September last year. The government said the laws were aimed at modernising India’s vast agriculture sector and would increase the income of the farmers by giving them more choices to sell their produce. But the farmers said the laws would give private corporations control over the sector and deprive them of a minimum support price (MSP) guaranteed by the government for their produce. Last month, Modi made a surprise U-turn, apologising to the nation in a TV address and saying he would roll back the controversial legislations. His announcement came ahead of crucial regional elections in ”grain bowl” states of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. ‘Huge victory for farmers’ Visuals shared by journalists and news organisations on social media showed many farmers removing tents from the main protest site at Singhu outside capital New Delhi on Thursday. A victory march will be held on Saturday to celebrate the campaign’s victory against the laws, Balbir Singh Rajewal said at one of the protest camps on the outskirts of New Delhi, The Press Trust of India news agency reported. “It is a huge victory for the farmers,” Singh told Al Jazeera. “This is a big loss for Narendra Modi.” Balbir Singh Rajewal, a senior leader of a coalition of farmers’ unions, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (United Farmers’ Front) said they have “received a letter from the government which has conceded to our requests”. But farmers’ leaders would meet on January 15 to review progress on the government’s assurances, Rajewal told a news conference. “We will resume our protests if the government moves away from the assurances,” said Gurnam Singh Charuni, another farmers’ leader. From Saturday, farmers will start leaving the protest site on the outskirts of the Indian capital of New Delhi, they said.",Left
1670,1670,"On 31st October, Statue of Unity, world’s tallest statue, was unveiled by Prime Minister Modi to mark the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. However, the statue got people talking for a reason other than expected.

At the location of the statue, a board has been installed that carries the translations of the phrase ‘Statue of Unity’ in 10 different languages. But as soon as the pictures of the inauguration came out people found out that the board carried the wrong translation of the phrase in Tamil. The error attracted the anger of the Tamil speaking people on Twitter.After the news went viral, a top official from the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam dismissed the image as fake. “The viral image of the erroneous Tamil translation of the Statue of Unity is a mischievous attempt by someone to tarnish the event that is a grand tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel”, the official had said.

This prompted several websites to run a fact check, declaring the images as fake.However, in a major embarrassment to the Gujarat government, the photo was also posted from the official account of Gujarat Chief Minister’s Office showing plaque with the wrong Tamil translations. The tweet was subsequently deleted.A journalist associated with BBC Gujarati, Tejas Vaidya had also photographed the same plaque on 30th October. His photo, and also the photo posted by Gujarat CMO, shows that the Tamil text is actually masked with tape, but as the tape is semi-transparent, the text is still visible. This means that someone had already spotted the mistake before the statue was inaugurated and attempted to cover it.

The mistake was admitted by the Gujarat government later. “We had outsourced event management works to private agencies. When it was brought to our notice, we immediately blacked it out,” a government official said when contacted by The Hindu, adding that they would put up a new plaque with proper translations soon.",Left
1365,1365,"The (Re)Discovery of India: Extracts from reflections on the Bharat Jodo Yatra
Extracts from the many thoughtful reflections published in the pages of National Herald during the 3,750 km odyssey that started in Kanyakumari on 7 Sept 2022 and ends in Srinagar on 30 Jan 2023            Why ‘Bharat Jodo’ brings to mind ‘Bharat Chhodo

YUSUF MEHERALLY was not even 40 when he wrote and circulated the booklet titled ‘Quit India’ in August 1942 after his suggested name for the proposed civil disobedience movement was accepted by Mahatma Gandhi. By then, he had already been imprisoned several times for embracing independence. He was the youngest Mayor of Bombay and immensely popular for his administrative efficiency and welfare measures.

The ‘Quit India’ cry resonated with India’s teeming millions. People translated the phrase in their own languages— Chale Jaav (literally, get lost) in Marathi and ‘Bharat Chhodo’ in Hindi. The intent was the same, the determination equally strong, whether articulated in Tamil or Asamiya or Gujarati. It gave pithy expres_x0002_sion to what everyone felt—everyone had had enough.

Bharat Jodo rhymes well with ‘Bharat Chhodo’. But it’s more than just the rhyme or rhythm of the two, their surface resemblance, that makes the two movements alike. There are very many reasons why Bharat Jodo might revive memories of Bharat Chhodo and indeed become Bharat Chhodo 2.

As the movement unfolds, so will its possibilities. ‘Bharat Jodo’ too may even_x0002_tually be translated into India’s many languages and perhaps become ‘Connect India’ in English, ‘Samparkisalu Bharata’ in Kannada, ‘Inaikka Natu’ in Tamil, ‘Desh Jodishu’ in Gujarati, and so on.

Once again, it will resonate with the feelings of millions of gagging, suffocating Indians. The spirit of the movement is the same. The same faith underpins it: that India is a ‘union of states’, and it survives if our diversities are respected and allowed to thrive; we are one because we are many. 

Bharat Jodo is, therefore, a movement to remind people that we are a nation because we are founded upon our Constitution, which defines us as a union of states—both geographical and ‘mental states’—including people of widely varied cultural practices, theological affiliations and linguistic identities.

In the simplest terms, the objective of the Innaika Natu or Desh Jodishu movement is to reconnect Indians to their Constitution, to bridge the emotional gulf between the idea of India and its people whose minds have been bombarded with divisive sentiment. The Bharat Jodo movement, like Bharat Chhodo, is about all Indians, not just people who live in cities nor only those who pay taxes; not just productive agers nor just voters: it is about every last Indian, regardless of age, gender, caste, religion and economic status.             Giving the ‘givers’ their due respect

KALAMNURI appeared in the news because Rahul Gandhi and the Bharat Jodo Yatra walked through the town and made a night halt there. In anticipation of the Yatra, poet-novelist Shrikant Deshmukh and thinker Datta Bhagat formed a group of writers named Sahitya Dindi. Dindi refers to the age-old tradition of ‘a procession of poets’ involved in the annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur, known as ‘Wari’.

They asked if I’d help set up a meeting with Rahul Gandhi as I was involved in handling the civil society interaction with the Bharat Jodo Yatra. When I reached Kalamnuri, on the eve of the Yatra’s arrival, I found the writers gath_x0002_ered on the premises of the Cambridge English School.

Our meeting with Rahul Gandhi was scheduled at 2 pm. We were asked to reach the tent an hour earlier. It was a surprise for all in the group, of some 25 writers and activists, that senior Congress leaders personally received the group, conversed with them and escorted them to the meeting in a makeshift tent.

Rahul arrived at the appointed hour. He had walked about 15 km that morning, but there was no sign of fatigue; he looked cheerful. After I introduced the group to him and after brief statements by three writers, he asked if he could intervene.

He was curious to know if the writers could think of a single word that describes all productive and working people, a word that does not have any shade of contempt or indignity. This led to a brain-storming session about the semantic layers and sociological connotations of terms like ‘Dalit’, ‘proletariat’, ‘bahujana’, ‘loka/ log’, ‘janata’ and so on.

The discussion also went over well-worn official social categories like SC/ ST/ OBC and ‘minorities’. It touched upon historically used terms like shramana as against brahmana and praja and raja. Rahul said: “Please consider how we can think of the large majority in India who are producers, the majority that ‘gives’, so that we can give them the dignity that history and society have denied them.”

Rahul has been walking day after day, meeting these groups, talking to people, trying to understand their lives, emotions, thoughts, and sharing with them his own concerns, his dream of creating a society that can live in harmony.

The Yatra has been extremely challenging, just the super-human physical stamina required for it makes it daunting. The number of group meetings and public meetings day after day makes it even more so. Yet, one sees Rahul Gandhi and his colleagues on the Yatra exuding joy as if they have found a great spiritual strength, a certain nasha, as a Sufi would say, or brahmananda as a Hindu saint might put it.

The divine delight that Rahul Gandhi has brought to the Yatra cannot be captured by any political analysis. It cannot be understood if seen as a make-over and transformation of a persona. It can only be understood if it is seen as a pure desire to re-create Indian society as a society based on the values of respect, dignity, equality and love for all.

Rahul speaks English and Hindi but no other Indian language. He is no poet in any traditional sense. Yet, the way children are drawn to him, the utter comfort women of all ages feel walking with him, the complete absence of cliché and the power of a non-lingual message the Yatra is spreading indicate that Rahul is con_x0002_ducting a semiotic experiment of the kind unknown in history.

The appeal of the Yatra lies not in what it says; it is in its ability to move the minds and hearts of people without saying much. It says exactly what the age-old harmony between different religious groups in Kalamnuri says to India: ‘even if you do not acknowledge my presence, I am timeless and I am here, for as long as India is India’.                       Fissures in our society the Yatra hopes to bridge

GOING BY eyewitness accounts, the Bharat Jodo Yatra has been a phenomenal success. So much so that debating its success/ failure is now a prime-time obsession. Many of these TV debates are biased, but it’s neither right nor fair to dismiss them all as ‘manufactured’; there is an attempt to gauge the impact of the Yatra. Not even just in TV studios but in political circles too. There is also a perceptible curiosity among common folk about the Yatra, about what makes it so different.

They have heard, of course, that the Yatra is not about elections or electoral gains—and the outcome of the recently concluded assembly elections in Gujarat and Himachal lend some credence to that assertion. Nor is it about unifying the Opposition. A rather ludicrous theory doing the rounds is that the Yatra is to salvage/ burnish Rahul Gandhi’s image; this deserves no comment. But that also begs the question what the Yatra is really about, if not any of the above.

The answer is the name itself—the words ‘Bharat Jodo’ (reconnect India) declare, loud and clear, what the Yatra seeks to do. But to grasp the spirit and the urgency of this mission, it is necessary to comprehend the disconnect the RSS and BJP are cynically engineering.

The most visible disconnect is, of course, the great trust deficit between the Hindus and Muslims (also Christians) and the great gap between the super-rich and the poor. These have featured in Rahul’s speeches throughout the Yatra.

There are three other divisions the RSS has worked hard to create—think of them as mental walls, designed to divide. The first of these walls stands between the truth of things and the information circulated about them among people. Supplicant media is made the instrument to effect this divide.

Two, the massive negative propaganda about Congress leaders, both living and dead, which serves to tarnish their public image and demoralise party workers. Never before has a political party spent so much sinister energy maligning opposition leaders.

The third wall stands between Indians and their understanding of their past. It tries to divide the people of India from their real history—of diverse communities, languages, cultures and what Nehru described as India’s palimpsestic past— and concoct an alternative narrative that somehow validates the RSS’s fiction of a once-glorious Hindu India. The current government has done its damnedest to embellish and embroider this fiction.

In the Sangh schema, all that India knew of its past is made to look like a diabolic conspiracy of European scholars and post-Independence Indian historians. Also integral to this project are attempts to sanitise history of elements that expose the Sangh’s own dubious past.

Prof. Kesavan Veluthat, president of the recently held Indian History Congress in Chennai, said the Vajpayee government had started concealing documents published by the Indian Council for Historical Research, documents that apparently exposed the Sangh’s dubious deals with the British Raj.             The re-feminisation of our politics

IT WAS Mahatma Gandhi who first ‘feminised’ politics in India. Sure, there were women in Indian politics, and in the Indian National Congress too, even before he returned to India from South Africa in 1915, but they weren’t that many, and near_x0002_ly all were from the upper classes and elite families.

Not that they didn’t make a contribution. Many of them were accomplished women, who argued vigorously for women’s education and to secure for them the right to vote and contest elections. Bimala, the woman protagonist of Rabindranath Tagore’s novel Ghare Baire, published in 1916, stepped out of the confines of a conservative home to take part in the Swadeshi movement.

Women in Bengal had even taken part in armed rebellion against colonial rule but, again, you could count them on your fingertips. Nonviolent protest suited the likes of Bimala, indeed most Indian women.

Gandhi’s resolute yet non-violent brand of protest appealed to even home-bound women; it was something they could afford to do. They stepped out of their homes in their numbers for the first time for Gandhi’s satyagraha, each inspiring others of the family to follow suit.

This was a ‘feminisation’ of our politics on a scale never seen before—Gandhi had opened the floodgates. Women embraced his political idiom—of ahimsa (non-violence) and satyagraha (peaceful protest) against injustice, in search of satya (the truth)— with unstinting enthusiasm.

A century later, the Bharat Jodo Yatra replays memories of those days, as women, young and old, step out to walk with Rahul Gandhi. This is remarkable especially because women still comprise only 14 per cent of the Lok Sabha; in state legislatures, they are even fewer. It is happening at a time when politics has become—and is widely being seen as—venal, violent and a sphere still dominated by men.

For hearts and minds hardened by the cynicism our politics easily engenders, it is hard to accept this manifest transformation, but for others, the sight of a swelling multitude of women walking in step, shoulder to shoulder with the men, with a sense of renewed hope, is unmissable.

Roughly a third of the Yatris are women, the crowds still dominantly male. And yet there is a comfortable familiarity in their physical connect with Rahul Gandhi—for women, both young and old, hugging and kissing Rahul Gandhi in full public view seems like the most natural thing. Even more importantly, they seem to be sharing their experiences and ideas for a better India without any inhibition.

The photographs and videos of this ongoing Bharat Jodo Yatra are sending out a powerful signal and indicate another phase of feminisation of Indian politics. Rahul has to toil much more, of course, before he can empower these women and a lot will depend on his will to stay the course. But in the way he is engaging with them, Rahul seems to carry a sense that to transform Indian politics, it must become a safe and comfortable space for women, that they have to play an important part in nation-building.

Chayanika Shah, a Mumbai based queer rights activist and spokesperson for queer feminism, says candidly: “I have watched these videos at length, sometimes for as long as 15 minutes at a stretch and have been moved by them.”

“Women betraying their emotions in public, breaking down in tears are powerful images. Women are sensitive to touch and can differentiate between good touch and bad touch. The images say a lot about Rahul Gandhi also, who is the rare Indian politician—perhaps the only one at this time—who can be dignified, sensitive and respectful while hugging women in public. The women are also clearly comfortable and secure, which is why they do not mind him holding their hand in front of others and talking to them,” she says.",Left
836,836,"The ruling BJP in Gujarat got a shot in the arm on Thursday when former Congress leaders Hardik Patel and Shweta Brahmbhatt joined the party. They were inducted into the BJP by the state party president C R Paatil at a function held at Shree Kamalam, Koba, near Gandhinagar. 

Patel was the Gujarat Congress working president and Brahmbhatt was an AICC delegate from Gujarat and had unsuccessfully contested the 2017 assembly elections. 

The two joined the saffron party in a span of about half an hour. 

Patel had shot to fame by leading Patidar Reservation Stir in 2015. 

Though Patel and Brahmbhatt have nothing to do with each other, sources said that a couple of days ago Patel had thrown tantrums asking why he was being equated with Brahmbhatt. It is believed that it is for this reason that the BJP planned their induction ceremonies separately. 

Except for Paatil and former deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, none of the top party leaders in Gujarat was present on the dais when Patel joined. 

While addressing the media and answering questions, Patel said that he had joined the BJP as a soldier. He praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 

Interestingly, both Paatil and Nitin Patel left the stage before Patel began to address the media. Normally, the BJP state leaders remain present when the person who is inducted addresses the media. On Thursday, only BJP spokespersons and party youth leaders were present to flank Patel. 

Some of his former colleagues during the times of Patidar Reservation Stir, who had joined the BJP earlier, were also conspicuous by their absence. 

Patel’s joining the BJP has evoked mixed responses from his former colleagues. 

It is believed that Patel has made a mistake and his career will be “finished” like that of Alpesh Thakor, a Congress turncoat, who contested an assembly election on a BJP ticket from his seat but lost. 

However, having joined the BJP, Patel can seemingly get relief in several cases, including that sedition, that is against him. 

In stark contrast to Patel, it is believed that the BJP has inducted Brahmbhatt to give her some role. She had called on Modi in Gandhinagar during one of his recent visits to the state.

Both Patel and Brahmbhatt joined the BJP along with their supporters. 

Saints from the Swaminarayan sect were present to bless Patel. 

Patel took out a two-kilometre roadshow to reach the state BJP headquarters. 

While the BJP makes use of Patel or cuts him to size only time would tell, but he's joining the BJP is certainly a loss for the opposition Congress for he brought with him youth. 

Patel claimed that every week more Congress leaders would be resigning. ",Center

As Prime Minister, Dr Singh’s chances of carrying forward the reformist zeal of his liberal economics was severely constrained by the Congress leadership’s strategy of going back to its socialist moorings and populist governance.  How was the idea of political change now finding cinematic expression in the country’s most watched film industry? Was it responding to the new political conversations that the information age had shaped in digital space and the realignment of political forces and imperatives in the country?

To begin with, the political films of the period had the element of hindsight. The year 2005 will be known for a film which sought to reinterpret the heady days of the left wing movement in Indian campuses in the 1960s and 1970s. Director Sudhir Mishra’s Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi (released in 2005), clearly on its way to be counted as one of the classics of Hindi screen, was seen mushily (and hence, wrongly) as “a post-dated love letter to that lost generation’’. In weaving the tale of Hindu College radical romantics Siddharth Tyabji (played by Kay Kay Menon) and Geeta Rao (played by Chitrangada Singh), both from well-to-do families, heading to Bihar to shape peasant revolution and the subsequent disillusionment, Sudhir Mishra’s interpretation is actually closer to what journalist and novelist Manu Joseph wrote in The Illicit Happiness of Other People: “The most foolish description of the young is that they are rebellious.”

The only credible revolt, sanctified by self-interest, is led by middle-class power broker Vikram Malhotra (played by Shiney Ahuja) in the film against his rich friends’ fanciful ideas of revolution. Here in this scene, while meeting his college friends who are trying to teach and bring Marxist revolution in a village in Bihar, he mocks his friends abusing their privilege to experiment with fanciful ideas of rural poverty. Instead, as a man of the world, he senses an opportunity to use rural land to make retreat cottages.Two years later, following the Supreme Court nod, Anurag Kashyap’s Black Friday was released in India. A screen adaptation of Hussain Zaidi’s book Black Friday – The True Story of the Bombay Bomb Blasts, the film sought to piece together the investigation into the 1993 serial bomb blasts in Mumbai (what was then Bombay) which claimed around 250 lives in different parts of the city. Its release was given go-ahead by the apex court only after the accused were convicted by the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (TADA) Act court as they had sought a stay on the release of the film claiming that it will colour public opinion and the court against them.

With Kay Kay Menon playing Deputy Commissioner of Police Rakesh Maria and supported by other compelling performances from a low-profile cast, the film tried to be as clinical as the book in weaving a narrative of the one of the most communally charged phases of violence in the city’s history following the Hindu-Muslim riots of 1992-93. What, however, makes the film gain its political hue is its depiction of the communalisation of Mumbai underworld, and how they opted for bombings in public places rather than going for lethal attacks on political leaders whom they identified as key drivers of identity politics – L K Advani and Bal Thackeray. The active support of Pakistan’s state apparatus to the terrorist act is chronicled in the film. This is one of the scenes giving a clue as to why public places were bombed:Kashyap wasn’t appealing when he moved from recorded history to fiction for telling a political tale. Gulaal(2009) tried to tell too many things in an imagined mix of student and redundant Rajputana royalty politics set in Rajasthan with a naivete, which became the undoing of the film. In addressing the themes of the impulses of secessionism, the fragilities and the hypocrisy of the powerful and the pull of the glorious legacy as subtext to claims on power, Kashyap reveals too many chinks in his understanding, or fantasies, of what constitutes “the political” in contemporary India.

In fact, three years later in Gangs of Wasseypur (2012) Part 1 Kashyap began with promising scenes to chronicle the politics of coal in the mineral-rich part of Jharkhand, with the attendant subtext of stakeholders including the capital-state-labour relations, but frittered it away by making the sideshow of gang wars as the centerpiece of the film.What Kashyap, obviously, missed is the point that the evolution of 19th century feudal fiefdoms into the skewed labour-capital relations of the modern coal mining sector has many complex historical strands to it, the mafia rivalries can only be a footnote to this complex history, not the expansive leitmotif.

Meanwhile, Prakash Jha had almost turned his filmmaking into an assembly line of films with political themes, but none rising above the formulaic stereotypes that define the sense of the political in Bollywood. He directed Apaharan (2005) on the  crime-politics nexus in Bihar’s kidnapping industry, Rajneeti  (2010) portraying the power play within a political family, Aarakshan (2011) trying to have a melodramatic take on affirmative action, Chakrayuh (2012) trying to cinematically decode Naxalism, and Satyagrah ( 2013) trying to make sense of the agitational politics in the aftermath of Anna movement.
The dilettante’s cinematic analysis of issues in simplistic binaries of right and wrong are evident in Jha’s forays into making political films, and so was the case with Vishal Bharadwaj’s Haider (2014). In his Shakespearean take on the Kashmir insurgency and military-citizen equations in the state, Bhardwaj recycles the clichéd narratives of victimhood and coercive state trampling over human rights – all that at the cost of nuanced understanding of the ground situation in the state. When filmmaking degenerates into activism, it becomes a visual agency of polemics – so was Haider. Such dumbing down of multiple strands and aspects enmeshed in political conversations was also evident in Vivek Agnihotri’s Buddha in a Traffic Jam (2016). Agnihotri’s dabbles with policy prescriptions and schools of thought only to produce a film which ends up as a vague and cinematic call for ‘revolution’ led by youth – you know you are watching the wrong political film if the film has a political message of its own too.

This year Madhur Bhandarkar, another filmmaker who fancies himself as the creator of an assembly line of theme-based films, came up with Indu Sarkar (2017) a fictional take on the Emergency years of India’s post-Independence democratic journey. Reviewing the film, this author had observed that the film was a failure of ambition. Bhandarkar, predictably, frittered away the opportunity of being a screen chronicler of a testing phase for India’s democracy. What he ended up doing was merely reinforcing stereotypes and popular history with the subtext of a morality play- something disastrous to do in a political tale.

The series began its brief survey of the political landscape of Hindi cinema with the observation that Hindi silver screen’s encounter with political churning in the country has ranged from fleeting glimpses to intense leitmotif. Sometimes it has given impressions of a dabbling dilettante, sometimes that of an engaged visual chronicler and sometimes that of an involved commentator. Seven decades after Independence, the craft of political films hasn’t yet come of age in Bollywood. Whenever that happens, one thing should be quite clear – morality and activism shouldn’t intervene in cinematic tales of politics around us.

1362,1362,"Rahul Gandhi says his disqualification from Lok Sabha has given him huge opportunity
Referring to his disqualification from Lok Sabha as a Member of Parliament, Gandhi, 52, said he didn't imagine that something like this was possible              Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has said that he did not imagine his disqualification from Lok Sabha was possible when he joined politics but asserted that it has given him a ""huge opportunity"" to serve the people.

Gandhi, who is in the US for a three-city US tour, made the remarks on Wednesday night in response to a series of questions from Indian students at the prestigious Stanford University Campus in California.

The Wayanad (Kerala) Member of Parliament was disqualified from Lok Sabha earlier this year after he was convicted by a Surat court in a 2019 criminal defamation case over his ""Modi surname"" remark.

In his remarks, Gandhi said that when he joined politics in 2000, he never imagined this is what he would go through. What he sees going on now is way outside anything that he had thought when he joined politics.      Referring to his disqualification from Lok Sabha as a Member of Parliament, Gandhi, 52, said he didn't imagine that something like this was possible.

""But then I think it's actually given me a huge opportunity. Probably much bigger than the opportunity I would have. That's just the way politics works,"" he said.

""I think the drama started really, about six months ago. We were struggling. The entire opposition is struggling in India. Huge financial dominance. Institutional capture. We're struggling to fight the democratic fight in our country,"" he said, adding that at this point in time, he decided to go for the Bharat Jodo Yatra'.

""I am very clear, our fight is ours fight,"" he said. ""But there is a group of young students from India here. I want to have a relationship with them and want to talk to them. It's my right to do it,"" he said during his interaction with Indian students and academicians of Indian origin at the University.               He also emphasised in his frequent foreign trips like this, he is not seeking support from anybody.

""I don't understand why the prime minister doesn't come here and do it,"" Gandhi asked amidst applause from the audience who had packed the entire auditorium at Stanford.

The moderator said that the Prime Minister is welcome to come to Stanford anytime and interact with the students and academicians.

Some of the students were denied entry as the auditorium was packed. Students started queuing up two hours before the event started.

1715,1715,"Kumar Ketkar: Back to Future—Spectre of 2069!
Not only geography of the world will have changed, but also the history which will be freshly written by two legends of the 21st century, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah                    Addressing the National Executive meeting of the BJP, Amit Shah said that not only the victory in 2019 is certain, the party will decimate the Congress totally and vanquish the so-called “Mahagatbandhan”! Then like oracle, he proclaimed that the BJP will rule for next 50 years. That is at least till the year 2069!

But this is not a new prediction. According to the ardent “Bhakts” of Narendra Modi, Nostradamus had predicted 500 years ago, that he would become the Prime Minister of India. India will then rise to great glory. Once Modi becomes PM, apparently prophesied the legendary French philosopher, India will have not just “Acche Din” but fantastic “din”! Amit Shah did not quote Nostradamus, but went on to see his own crystal ball.

The entire leadership of the party, gathered in Delhi to the war cry for the campaign for 2019, was thrilled by Shah’s prediction. They could not visualise themselves to be in Hastinapur in 2069. But they could believe that Modi and Shah were immortal and could keep winning elections till 2069. They are not power hungry and will take “sanyas”, that year. They will renounce all worldly pleasures! But what about the other mortal BJP MPs? However, they felt relieved that in 2069, there would be no Gandhi-Nehru dynasty. That biggest hurdle to the Hindu Rashtra will have been long gone. Sri Sri Guru Golwalkar will be the “Rashtrapita”. The geography of the region will have undergone major changes. “Akhand Bharat” with Afghanistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Nepal will have merged in the “New Hindustan”. There would be no Pakistan. The question of sending Muslims in India to Pakistan would not arise. They would either have migrated to some Arab countries or be dead. “Akhand Bharat” would be the world leader.

Thus, by 2069, the world will have transformed so completely that Gandhiji would not even recognise the country which achieved Independence in 1947. That was of course the partial Independence. Therefore, Rashtrapita Gandhiji’s 200th birth anniversary will not be celebrated. Narendra Modi will be known, by ordinance, as “Akhand Hindustan Pita”. There will be no statue for Bhagwat in India. It will be erected in Chicago                       China will be reduced to a secondary power and US will have disintegrated like the USSR did in 1991. Donald Trump was the last President of the United States. He had reversed everything Abraham Lincoln had achieved. The country was divided into the North and the South. Trump’s efforts to restart the slavery system had succeeded but led to Civil War! Modi and Mohan Bhagwat had advised Trump to follow Manu Smriti instead of American Constitution, but he refused. India, on the other hand had reclaimed its ancient glory, thanks to Manu Smriti.

But all that was rather a distant future and some sceptics raised questions after the eloquent futurist speech of Shah. Those sceptics were invited to the 36th chamber of “ Shahlin “.In that chamber, there were ways to silence the sceptics. Even sceptics of the stature of LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi were silenced. So those doubting Thomases were also convinced of Modi-Shah’s strategy of eternal rule! Particularly after the sceptics were shown files of the Enforcement Directorate, IT and CBI.

So they realised that 50 years from now, Amit Shah will be 104-years-old and still as energetic as in 2018. (Sceptics will have retired from politics or jailed or dead) Shah was born on October 22, 1964. Narendra Modi would be 117 in 2069. But there is a slight dispute about his birthdate. According to his election affidavit, he was born on September 17, 1950, but some other biographers say he was born in 1949.

The sceptics who were not convinced after the meeting said that the futurist scenario painted by Shah did not take into account the future of the RSS, and of Mohan Bhagwat, who actually began the process of creating a Hindu Rashtra. Bhagwat had appealed from Chicago in 2018 that the Hindus of the world must unite. The impact of his speech was such that all the Indian Hindus in the US and in many other countries got united.

The initiative for that unity of the Hindus was taken by those thousands of software engineers who went to the US during the nineties. The management courses, started in the IIMs, set up by Pandit Nehru, had changed the syllabus to incorporate courses in Vedic HRD, ancient space logistics and Baba Ramdev’s yoga. There were regular tours to Moon, Mars, Venus and Brihaspati-Guru.

This Universal Space travel programme was started by Narendra Modi in 2018. NASA was now an Indo-American space research institution, named as Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Vishwa Avkash Kendra. unite.

The Margadarshak Mandal had proposed to build two statues, that of Modi and Shah, one in the liberated Pak-occupied Kashmir and the other near Ram Setu in the ocean linking India and Sri Lanka. These statues will be taller than that of Vallabhbhai Patel, which itself was taller than the Statue of Liberty and Shivaji Maharaj Statue in the Arabian Sea                    JNU was renamed in 2019, soon after the Congress was permanently demolished, as Atal Behari Vajpayee Vidyapeeth of Eminence (ABVVE). ABVVE had become a global university, eclipsing Harvard, Stanford and Yale. In fact, Yale University was renamed as Smriti Vidyapeeth, because Smriti Irani had studied there many years ago. Native Americans were now re-identified as ancient Indians. This is how the process of disintegration of the US began.

Despite all these monumental achievements under the Modi-Shah rule of 55 years, some wanted to know, will there be a conflict and power struggle between Bhagwat and Modi? Will the RSS and the Modi-Shah-Doval clique be able to work as one team? But then, the sceptics were firmly told that the RSS would be dissolved and Bhagwat will be irrelevant. Arun Jaitley, Piyush Goyal, Sushma Swaraj, Nirmala Sitharaman, Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari will be in the new Margadarshak Mandal. But then some rebellious sceptics raised other questions.

The Margadarshak Mandal had proposed to build two statues, that of Modi and Shah, one in the liberated Pak-occupied Kashmir and the other near Ram Setu in the ocean linking India and Sri Lanka. These statues will be taller than that of Vallabhbhai Patel, which itself was taller than the Statue of Liberty and Shivaji Maharaj Statue in the Arabian Sea. (By the way the Arabian Sea was named as Hedgewar Hindu Mahadagar).

Thus, by 2069, the world will have transformed so completely that Gandhiji would not even recognise the country which achieved Independence in 1947. That was of course the partial Independence. Therefore, Rashtrapita Gandhiji’s 200th birth anniversary will not be celebrated. Narendra Modi will be known, by ordinance, as “Akhand Hindustan Pita”. There will be no statue for Bhagwat in India. It will be erected in Chicago.

Valmiki wrote Ramayana before Ram actually arrived on the scene. Valmiki was a criminal-robber before becoming the great poet. That also proved to be a perfect and divine coincidence in history when Modi and Shah jointly scripted the “Narendrayana”.

This is a story and history of the next fifty years, which will be now part of the history text books. Not only geography of the world will have changed, but also history and even the Glimpses of World History, which will be freshly written by two Maharshis of the twenty-first century, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah.

So tighten your belts as you enter this Time Machine and begin the great journey to 2069. We will complete the journey in just eight months. So relax and enjoy the magnificent adventure which was started as a small step by launching the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet train in 2019.

75,75,"Why is the Magic of Narendra Modi Fading Away?                        Even those who once supported the BJP might now question the narrative around Prime Minister Narendra Modi. How much economic discomfort are people willing to endure for the sake of a leader’s grand vision?
Modi’s Initial Promise
When Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014, he presented a clear narrative. The previous UPA government was seen as corrupt and inefficient, holding together only through a shared dislike for India’s Hindu culture. Modi promised to change this, offering an administration that was both clean and efficient, proud of India’s heritage, and committed to promoting it. His narrative included a focus on lifting India materially while embracing Hindu pride. He also emphasized that his government would prioritize the poor, crafting a well-rounded and emotionally appealing story.
The Impact of Modi’s Story
This compelling narrative had a significant impact. For instance, when Modi asked wealthier citizens to give up their subsidized LPG connections, over one crore Indians complied without hesitation. Similarly, during the demonetization (DeMo) of 2016, despite the massive disruption it caused, there were no large-scale protests. Instead, the BJP secured a significant victory in Uttar Pradesh just months later, largely due to Modi’s leadership. The narrative at the time was that any inconvenience was justified as part of a larger fight against black money and corruption, giving people a sense of noble purpose.

A Shift in Perception
However, if Modi were to announce another demonetization today, it is likely that there would be widespread protests, potentially escalating to violence. What has changed since 2016? The issue is not Modi’s integrity or energy but the weakening of his broader narrative.

The Erosion of the ‘Story’
In 2016, demonetization was seen as a step towards reducing black money and improving India. Today, despite any progress made, corruption remains rampant at many levels of government, especially at the state level. Modi’s early years in power bought him some leeway, but a decade later, if local officials are still demanding bribes, people are less likely to support anti-corruption efforts led by Modi.

The Missing Emotional Connection
Earlier this year, speeches from the treasury benches emphasized how Modi’s third term would make India’s economy the third largest in the world—a crucial goal. However, this message lacked an emotional connection for ordinary citizens. For a homemaker in Shravasti who benefited from various government schemes, the idea of India having the third-largest GDP did not translate into a personal aspiration. Without a compelling national story, voters turned to local issues and narratives.

The Limits of Statistics
The BJP’s significant wins in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Odisha do not negate the fact that many supporters may have moved on from Modi’s narrative. In Gujarat and MP, BJP has built a strong base over the years, while in Odisha, specific local factors played a role. The point is not about BJP losing support, but about the shift in the perception of Modi’s narrative.

The Power of Stories
Human beings can endure hardship if they believe it serves a larger purpose. Without a meaningful narrative, suffering feels pointless and unbearable. At a societal level, people will overlook statistics if they are emotionally invested in their leader’s story. Stories provide meaning to experiences, helping people see beyond immediate hardships.

Conclusion
The narrative that once galvanized support for Modi is not as compelling today. For Modi to regain the emotional connection with the people, a new, powerful story(narratives and goals) needs to be told. Without it, even loyal supporters may question the sacrifices they are asked to make. Goals are essential because they give meaning to our lives and our collective experiences. Without them, we are merely individuals navigating a vast, indifferent universe.",Left

Vijayan said the trailer of the film, appears to be ""deliberately produced"" with the alleged aim of creating communal polarisation and spreading hate propaganda against the state                    Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday slammed the makers of 'The Kerala Story' film, saying they were taking up the Sangh Parivar propaganda of projecting the state as a centre of religious extremism by raising the issue of 'love jihad' -- a concept rejected by the courts, probe agencies and even the Home Ministry.

Vijayan also said the trailer of the Hindi film, at first glance, appears to be ""deliberately produced"" with the alleged aim of creating communal polarisation and spreading hate propaganda against the state.

He said despite the issue of 'love jihad' being rejected by probe agencies, courts and the MHA, it was being raised in connection with Kerala as the main premise of the film only to humiliate the state in front of the world.                 Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday slammed the makers of 'The Kerala Story' film, saying they were taking up the Sangh Parivar propaganda of projecting the state as a centre of religious extremism by raising the issue of 'love jihad' -- a concept rejected by the courts, probe agencies and even the Home Ministry.

Vijayan also said the trailer of the Hindi film, at first glance, appears to be ""deliberately produced"" with the alleged aim of creating communal polarisation and spreading hate propaganda against the state.

He said despite the issue of 'love jihad' being rejected by probe agencies, courts and the MHA, it was being raised in connection with Kerala as the main premise of the film only to humiliate the state in front of the world.               He also termed as ""double standards"" the Kerala CM and ruling CPI(M) stand that freedom of speech and expression cannot be a justification for using cinema to spread sectarianism in the state and create divisions.

""Freedom of expression is not a license to spread lies, communalise the society, and divide the people,"" the CM said earlier in the day.

Surendran said the CM and CPI(M) leaders, acting as ""apostles of expression"", are saying that the film -- 'The Kerala Story' -- should not be screened.

However, it was freedom of expression when believers reacted against 'Isho' movie or when Christians were allegedly insulted in the play 'Kakkukali' and also regarding 'Meesha' novel and exhibition of M F Hussain's paintings, Surendran contended.

On the other hand, the Left party did not see freedom of expression in the case of the question paper prepared by professor T J Joseph -- whose hand was chopped off for allegedly insulting Prophet Muhammed in a test -- or the play 'Kitab' or the film 'Kashmir Files', Surendran claimed.

He alleged that the reason for this double standard was CPI(M) does not want anything to expose terrorism.

The BJP state chief said people have seen through such ""selective secularism and selective freedom of expression"" and the ""CM should understand that double standards for vote bank politics was more dangerous than religious fundamentalism"".           Surendran contended it was due to such selective responses of the CM and the Leader of Opposition in the state assembly that a situation has been created where alleged ""jihadis"" were coming to Kerala to carry out terror acts in the country.

Vijayan, in his statement earlier in the day, alleged that since the Sangh Parivar's politics of division was not working in Kerala, as it did in other places, it was trying to spread it through a film based on ""fake stories"", unsupported by any fact or evidence.

""In the trailer of the movie, we see a hoax that 32,000 women in Kerala were converted and became members of the Islamic State. This bogus story is a product of the Sangh Parivar's lie factory,"" the CM contended in his statement.

Vijayan urged Malayalis to reject such moves and be vigilant against the attempts to spread communal unrest in the society through false propaganda. He also warned of legal action against anti-social activities.

A couple of days ago, both the ruling CPI(M) in Kerala and the opposition Congress hit out at the controversial upcoming movie 'The Kerala Story', saying freedom of expression was not a licence to spew venom in society, and the film was an attempt to destroy the communal harmony of the state.

The Congress urged the government not to give permission to screen the controversial movie as it aimed to create ""communal divisions in society through false claims"".          The Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), the youth wing of the ruling CPI(M), had also lashed out against the film and said its trailer itself hurt religious sentiments and sought stern action against it.

'The Kerala Story', starring Adah Sharma, is set to be released in cinemas on May 5. Written and directed by Sudipto Sen, the film is portrayed as ""unearthing"" the events behind ""approximately 32,000 women"" allegedly going missing in the southern state. The film falsely claims they converted, got radicalised and were deployed in terror missions in India and the world.

The film's writer-director Sudipto Sen's earlier movies are 'Aasma', 'Lucknow Times' and 'The Last Monk.' 'The Kerala Story' is backed by Sunshine Pictures Private Limited, founded by Vipul Amrutlal Shah, who serves as the producer, creative director and co-writer on the film. ",Left

PM Narendra Modi
RANAGHAT (WB): Prime Minister Narendra Modi Wednesday took a jibe at Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee calling her 'sticker didi' who labels central welfare schemes as those run by her government.
The reason why the electorate had voted the Left out of power in West Bengal and had supported her party has not been fulfilled by her, he said at an election rally here.
TMC, he claimed, has brought more miseries to the people of the state through goondaism, syndicates and extortion.
""Speedbreaker didi is also sticker didi. She just puts a sticker on central schemes like free electricity or ration for the people to claim that these benefits are being given the state government,"" he said.
Modi had earlier called Banerjee ""speedbreaker didi"" for allegedly blocking implementation of central schemes in the state.
Continuing his attack, the prime minister said Banerjee has betrayed the people of Bengal ""who gave her so much trust and respect"" and the reason why the electorate had voted the Left out of power has not been fulfilled by her so far.
Accusing Banerjee and her party of trying to browbeat the saffron party in West Bengal, Modi said that BJP is not afraid of intimidation and violence.
""If it was so, BJP would not have come to power in the country and become the world's largest political party from having only two MPs,"" he said.
He claimed that Banerjee, who used to shed tears in Parliament seeking that illegal immigrants be thrown out of the country, is now their biggest protector.
Asserting that the Citizenship (Amednment) Bill will be brought in Parliament, he said that all illegal immigrants will be thrown out of the country.
Accusing Banerjee of stopping the implementation of the 'Ayushman Bharat' health insurance scheme in the state and depriving millions of poor people of benefits of upto Rs five lakhs, the prime minister said ""It is an example of sick mentality.""

Chennai:For a state that holds the key to the country’s highest office, Tamil Nadu faces as many crises as there are players who are in the fray this time.
This is the first time that the people of TN will vote for the Centre in the absence of political supremos M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa. This election will also determine the future of the Dravidian parties and leaders like MK Stalin and Edapadi K Palaniswamy, both of whom badly need to win to prove their leadership abilities to the party cadre and the people of Tamil Nadu.
On one side, there is a strong alliance of caste-centric parties, backed by the ruling parties of the AIADMK and BJP , and on the other, there is the DMK which, after several defeats in the past ten years, is looking for a victory. The DMK is banking on the anti-incumbency against the state government, and a campaign targeting PM Modi for being a fascist and indifferent to the interests of Tamil people.
The AIADMK is taking on the DMK for its ‘corruption and rowdyism’ and is conspicuously not uttering a word against Congress president Rahul Gandhi or other Congress leaders.
According to C Lakshmanan, assistant professor, Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS), this election will determine the future of at least “one of the Dravidian parties. Either one of them will vanish or there will be a major churn if the results go one way. If the DMK alliance does well, it will give the Congress a chance to take corrective measures and rebuild itself here, after decades. We are hoping that a leader emerges during these polls, who can command votes from people, irrespective of caste boundaries, like Jayalalithaa or Karunanidhi did.”
Modi Factor
An AIIMS in Madurai, over six big infrastructure projects, a defence corridor, a special package to Tirupur garment industry, benefits under Mudra and Kisan Bima Yojna — these are some benefits that the Modi government gave Tamil Nadu in the past five years, according to senior BJP leaders.
“Be it the Gaja cylcone or Tamil New Year (April 14), he (Modi) has always made it a point to tweet in Tamil, send his people to the state etc,” they said.
But these don’t matter to people who feel the state’s autonomy has been infringed upon by BJP. The DMK has spun its campaign around the AIADMK being a puppet of the BJP.
Raju Manivannan, professor, Madras University, said, “people would vote out even their own leaders such as Karunanidhi or Jayalalithaa, despite the freebies, if they felt their dues were not being given. The implementation matters more than the idea.”
There have been over 200 protests in three years against the state and centre. The agitation against the Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi that ended in 13 deaths after police firing to the concerns over common medical entrance exam, NEET, and the Centre’s stand on Jallikattu are a few such instances.
However, people in Delhi feel language barrier is the problem. “The PM’s strength is his ability to communicate which doesn’t work in Tamil Nadu. We don’t have a strong leader like Himanta Biswa Sharma or Sarbananda Sonowal who can help us get the context right. That it was Modi who got the ordinance on Jallikattu also could not reach the people properly,” said a BJP leader.
This time the party is contesting just five of the 39 constituencies in the state, giving the rest to allies with the AIADMK taking 20 ––a sign of the party’s acknowledgement of its own limited reach in the state.
OBC Consolidation
The BJP has been focusing on OBC vote consolidation either on its own or through allies –– a strategy it has deployed in states including UP, Bihar, Gujarat and Karnataka.
While the DMK has an alliance with the Congress, CPI(M), CPI, MDMK headed by Vaiko, VCK, a Dalit party, Indian Union Muslim League, Manithaneya Makkal Katchi, and Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi, a Gounder outfit, the AIADMK- BJP combine is banking on the consolidation of OBC communities such as Gounders, Thevars and Vanniyars. The latter is projecting the CM’s face to be a Gounder and trying to bring together the PMK, the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC), the Puthiya Tamizhagam (PT), and the Puthiya Needhi Katchi (PNK).
ET learns that bringing parties such as PMK and DMDK together was no minor feat for the BJP and the AIADMK, and BJP supremo Amit Shah had personally designated minister Piyush Goyal to achieve this. While DMK leaders believe that aligning with the BJP has affected AIADMK’s fortunes, and will suit them, an AIADMK minister said: “All of us are working together and giving a tough fight. Aligning with the ruling party is beneficial in many ways, only that we expected them to spend more.”
There are new factors too. Tamil superstar-turned politician Kamal Haasan has emerged as a fringe player while Jayalalitha ’s close aide Sasikala’s nephew TTV Dinakaran sees himself as a claimant to Jayalalithaa’s legacy. His party, an AIADMK breakaway group –– Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) –– may not win seats, but might be a spoiler in some seats, like in Theni where deputy CM O Panneerselvam’s son is contesting.
AIADMK-BJP Alliance
The AIADMK, after Dhinakaran engineered a split, is unsure of its own vote base, so are the allying seven parties, all of which are regional. According to a PMK leader working in North Tamil Nadu, while PMK is able to convert its votes for AIADMK, the reverse is not happening.
“PMK is a smaller party with limited resources. All our contests are tough with DMK candidates. The transfer (of votes) is not happening at the rate we expected.” The alliance is trying to get the maximum seats in the western belt that has been its bastion for years.
Money factor
The tradition of buying votes is nothing new. The EC has, till now, seized over Rs 500 crore of unaccounted cash and jewellery in the state this year. In 2016, it registered around 100 cases of poll-related bribery and had countermanded voting in three constituencies, where voters were suspected to have been bribed. All three constituencies were won by the AIADMK in the by-polls held later. Both the major parties are keeping a close watch on the movement of cash and gifts by their respective rivals.
Stalin’s Future
In 2016, when the DMK lost after MK Stalin’s aggressive campaign, it was seen as a failure of Karunanidhi’s chosen heir. A third place in the highly dramatic RK Nagar poll after Jayalalithaa’s death, intensified the debate on his position. “This time, he has to prove his leadership by getting at least 35 seats because the circumstances are favourable for the party. He will be forced to justify if the party-led alliance gets less than 28 seats,” a senior DMK leader said.
Political commentator Perumal Mani said there was a marked difference in Stalin’s campaign this time. “He took blessings from Rajathiammal, has gone to campaign for even candidates who are loyal to others in the party.”
The entry of Stalin’s son Udhayanidhi in state politics, and his sister Kanimozhi contesting from Thoothukudy have made the battle more interesting. “It is also about who will succeed him. Even in this election, he was unable to get major alliance partners. He is yet to show results,” a DMK leader added.
“In some ways, the by-polls that would take place simultaneously with the Lok Sabha polls are more important for the state,” a DMK leader said.CM Palaniswamy who, till 2017, was a low-profile, Gounder leader and a member of Jayalalithaa’s close coterie, will have to deliver not just to stay in power in the party and in the government but also to hold claim to the legacy of MGR and Jayalalithaa

1,1,"There seems to be no end to the political drama in Karnataka as fresh reports claim that Congress ministers in the Congress-JDS coalition government may resign to accommodate rebel MLAs.

Reportedly, Bangalore Rural MP and senior Congress leader DK Suresh speaking to media said that all Congress ministers are set to resign from the coalition amidst speculations that a new government may be formed after the resignation of 14 Congress-JDS MLAs.

Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara has called for a breakfast meeting among all Congress ministers in the Karnataka government and there is a possibility that some of them may be asked to step down to make way for some or all of the dissenting MLAs to get ministerial berths. Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy is also scheduled to attend the breakfast meeting which is being held at Parameshwara’s residence.

Meanwhile, independent MLA Nagesh, who was made a minister in the Congress-JDS government recently has also submitted his resignation letter to Governor Vajubhai Vala today. In his letter, Nagesh has claimed that he wishes to withdraw the support he had given to the HD Kumaraswamy government.

On Saturday, the Congress-JDS coalition was pushed to the edge after 13 Congress and JD(S) MLAs submitted their resignations to bring its number to 105, on par with the BJP, in the 224-member Assembly.

Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, who had gone to the United States on a personal visit had to rush back after a series of resignation threatened the existence of his government. HD Kumaraswamy returned back to Bangalore on Sunday and held a series of meetings with leaders of his party JD(S) and its ally Congress in a bid to rescue the coalition government.",Center

Several opposition parties have raised doubts over the credibility and efficacy of EVMs and claimed that they can be tampered with and manipulated.
Agencies
On some outfits demanding that all votes polled through EVMs be verified with at least 50 per cent Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPATs), Krishnamurthy said if they lose polls, they would even say it's also inadequate.
Former Chief Election Commissioner T S Krishnamurthy said Wednesday he saw no end to Electronic Voting Machine ( EVM ) bashing as losers in elections would continue to grumble against their usage.
Several opposition parties have raised doubts over the credibility and efficacy of EVMs and claimed that they can be tampered with and manipulated.
On some outfits demanding that all votes polled through EVMs be verified with at least 50 per cent Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPATs), Krishnamurthy said if they lose polls, they would even say it's also inadequate.
""So, this game will go on. I think they (EVM bashing parties) are more interested in paper ballot, which will give more opportunity for more frauds; but if this is what they want, what can we do?"", he said in anguish.
""They will keep on grumbling. Those who are not winning, they will grumble; those who are winning they will keep quiet; when they (those who won earlier) lose, they will grumble. This game goes on,there is no end to it"",he told PTI.
Krishnamurthy, who oversaw the 2004 general elections, also called for arming the Election Commission with extra powers.
According to him, imposing campaign curbs for 24 hours or 48 hours or 72 hours for hate speeches are inadequate and ""will not solve the problem"".
""In my opinion, if there are hate speeches, first offence...you can give them some kind of warning, second offence...one week's ban, third offence...they must be disqualified"", Krishnamurthy advocated.
During the election process time, the EC must have powers to suspend, disqualify or debar a person, he said.
The model of conduct, which comes into effect once the election schedule is declared, is not a law and the EC can only issue warnings and reprimand in case of violations, Krishnamurthy noted.
""Considering the way politicians behave today, it's not adequate, you must make them realise that they have to pay a price for hate speeches"", he stressed.
Noting the smashing of an EVM by a party candidate in Anantapuram district of Andhra Pradesh during voting on April 11, Krishnamurthy said only an FIR could be filed against him.
""If his (the candidate's) party comes to power, FIR may be withdrawn; this is the way things are happening. So we have to be tough in certain regard, and for that you need certain powers (for EC)"", he said.
Krishnamurthy also said he had always held the view that there was no point in having an expenditure ceiling for candidates contesting elections when there was no such limit for political parties.
He added that a collegium should select Election Commissioners -- and not the government, which is the practice at present -- on the lines of the appointment of the Chief Vigilance Commissioner.
""EC has recommended this (Election Commissioners' selection by collegium), but political parties in power are not interested in the change. Opposition parties when they come to power, they forget about it"", Krishnamurthy added.

1651,1651,"Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti (ABSS), an umbrella organisation of over 3000 Hindu saints from 127 sects on Sunday appealed their followers and other Hindus to ensure that the Narendra Modi government returns to power in 2019. The sadhus after rigorous deliberations also passed a resolution demanding the Union government to bring an ordinance or a law to build the Ram Mandir.

The Sadhus from across the country had come together at the Delhi’s Talkatora stadium to discuss the future course of action to be pursued following the Supreme Court’s decision to postpone the hearing of the Ram Mandir case. The Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti on Sunday asked the people to bring back Narendra Modi government in the upcoming 2019 elections. People should vote for those who have faith in “Gau, Ganga, Geeta, Gayatri and Govind”, they said.

The Delhi conclave deliberated on a number of issues, including construction of the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, a parliamentary legislation for cow protection, cleaning of the Ganga river. “We direct the government to either bring in a law or an ordinance (for the construction of the Ram temple). There will be no compromise on this,” Ramanandacharya Hansdevacharya, the patron of the organisation, said in his concluding remarks at the conclave.

The Sants expressed their confidence in the Narendra Modi government. Ramanandacharya Hansdevacharya said that only BJP government can meet our expectations. “Apna desh bhi bachao, apni sanskriti bhi bachao, aur phir se iss Bharat ke andar yahi sarkar ko 2019 me wapas lao (Save the country and its culture, bring back this government in 2019)”, he said.

He further said that if Hindus want to protect their lives, temples and mutts, daughters and sisters, culture and tradition, then Narendra Modi government must be brought back. Hansdevacharya spoke about how sants were hurt with the deliberate obstruction caused against the building of the Ram temple at Ayodhya but also expressed satisfaction with the central government’s work related to the nation, religion, culture, national security, and national pride.

The ABSS statement also said that NOTA is an insult to democracy, and urged everyone to positively vote for the leader of their choice.

Sant Govindeo Giri of Pune said that “certain forces” were trying to destabilise the Modi government, and that a “conspiracy” against the government was being done in Madhya Pradesh. The gathering called for the creation of a new “Teerthan Ministry” to promote pilgrimages, and requested the government not turn these pilgrimage centres into tourism destinations.

The ‘Dharmadesh’ conclave also discussed issues like illegal immigration of the Rohingya Muslims and asked the government to deport them. The issues like the Uniform Civil Code and National Population Policy to control the “imbalance” were also discussed.

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar of Art of Living spoke about three possible ways forward on the issue of the Ram temple. He said that it can be solved through dialogue or by an appeal to the Supreme Court seeking an early verdict, and a third option by making a request to the central government.

The Sant Samiti has also announced three more “dharma sabhas” to be held in Ayodhya, Nagpur, and Bengaluru on November 25. The Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti is planning to hold a large congregation of sadhus in Delhi on December 9. It is planning to organise 500 more such meetings from December 18  across the country.

The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is also pushing for early construction of the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. Recently, RSS said that it will take up another agitation similar to the one in 1992 “if needed” in order to ensure the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat at his annual Vijayadashami celebration speech had urged the Narendra Modi-led BJP government of bringing in a law to build a Ram Mandir at the disputed land in Ayodhya.

The Supreme Court on October 29th adjourned hearings in the Ayodhya dispute until January next year. The Supreme Court has also said that it will decide in January whether the case should be heard in February, March, April or after that.",Right
412,412," , Foreign demand for a slice of Taiwan’s increasingly profitable companies is threatening to upend the central bank’s decades-old currency management policy., Central bank board member Chang Chien-yi told Bloomberg in a rare interview that the institution won’t be able to fight currency appreciation if the Taiwan dollar rises on economic fundamentals as the competitiveness of local industries improves., “The next two years will be an important turning point,” Chang said Wednesday. “The central bank will have to respect the markets. It won’t be able to forcefully slow the currency’s appreciation.”, The Taiwan central bank’s currency management has come under increased scrutiny, with the U.S. Treasury saying in April that it wants to ,  over the “structural undervaluation.” Investors have piled into the island’s tech-driven markets, as the economy outperforms peers that are still gripped by the pandemic, making the Taiwan dollar the best performer in Asia this year., The U.S.-China trade war has sparked a major ,  of supply chains and given opportunities to a wide range of Taiwanese exporters, according to Chang. It will also allow Taiwan’s central bank to rethink its currency policy, as exporters may be able to thrive without foreign-exchange support, he said., The Taiwan dollar rose to its highest level since July 1997 in April. Strategists are predicting that it will charge higher in the coming months, while the options market is also showing waning demand to hedge the currency against strength in the greenback. One-month risk reversals are holding close to the lowest level since March., The currency rose 0.3% to close at 27.908 against the dollar on Friday., “The comments suggest that the central bank will be willing to tolerate more currency strength, though they are wary of the impact that could have on firm profitability if it moves too much,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore., “It will be more important than ever for Taiwanese companies to manage their foreign exchange risks,” he said. “With the outlook for global trade looking very positive, we are likely to see further strength in the Taiwan dollar.”, Around 97% of companies in Taiwan are small and medium-sized enterprises and many of them are exporters, Chang said by phone. These companies have traditionally been very vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates, according to Chang, who also serves as the president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research., “If the Taiwan dollar strengthened, not only might these companies have worked for nothing, they could also be at risk of going bankrupt, which could have caused all kinds of societal problems,” he added. “SMEs didn’t have the means for currency hedging and they didn’t have a lot of cash on hand.” , Chang’s remarks are the latest signs of a new openness and tolerance for public debate at Taiwan’s typically taciturn central bank. Last month, two current and one former member of the policy board co-authored a book discussing how much damage the bank’s efforts to maintain a weak currency had done to the economy over the past 20 years., Chang, who joined the policy board in January last year, applauded the bank for improving transparency under current Governor Yang Chin-long. But, he pointed out that there are other areas the bank still needs to improve on., Almost all of the time at quarterly board meetings is taken up by reports from each of the bank’s departments, leaving little time to fully discuss policies, according to the recently published book -- a view that Chang agrees with., Most importantly, he said, the central bank should clearly define its monetary-policy goals, which would allow board members to discuss it in greater depth., ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center

The state also backtracked on an insistence that new entrants rent infrastructure such as telecom towers from state-owned Ethio Telecom indefinitely, they said., The concessions are part of Ethiopia’s drawn out effort to open its telecom market to outside investors, a central tenet of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s plans to reform the economy and generate foreign exchange. A consortium of Johannesburg-based MTN Group Ltd. and China’s Silk Road Fund submitted a bid earlier this week, as did a group including the U.K.’s Vodafone Group Plc and African partners., A response to the two offers is expected in coming days, the people said., Eyob Tekalign, the Ethiopian state minister responsible for the privatization process, couldn’t be reached for comment. Vodafone and MTN declined to comment on an ongoing process., Wireless carriers on the continent see mobile money as a major generator of revenue, as hundreds of millions of people use their phones for payments rather than traditional banks. M-Pesa Africa, the continent’s biggest such service and co-owned by Safaricom Ltd. and Vodacom Group Ltd., is valued at $14 billion, according to a research note by EFG Hermes., Ethiopia’s decision to open up the telecom industry was taken in mid-2018 and was initially part of a much wider privatization program, taking in sugar factories and railway infrastructure among other sectors. But the process has been hit by numerous setbacks, including the coronavirus pandemic, delayed elections and the regulatory complexity that comes with organizing a sale., The business case for phone companies was at first straightforward: Ethiopia has a population of more than 110 million, the second largest in Africa, yet less than half its people have mobile-phone subscriptions., ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center

823,823,"The Delhi government today presented the budget for the coming financial year, dubbing it as 'Rozgar Budget' that aims at restarting and strengthening economic growth and generating 20 lakh new jobs.

Delhi Finance Minister Manish Sisodia presented the budget, stating that it was an agenda to create new jobs for the people of Delhi and to boost economic recovery from the damage caused in recent years due to COVID-19, GST and demonetisation.

“The schemes and proposals presented in this budget will not only provide new entrepreneurship opportunities to the youth of Delhi, but will also benefit the already established enterprises and businesses,” he said.

Sisodia said the economy of Delhi is slowly emerging from the impact of COVID-19 and the gross state domestic product (GSDP) of the state at current market prices is likely to increase from Rs 7,85,342 crore in 2020-21 to Rs 9,23,967 crore in 2021-22, which is an increase of 17.65 per cent. The real growth rate of Delhi's GSDP, he said, is likely to be 10.23 per cent whereas at the national level, this growth rate is estimated to be 8.9 per cent.

The contribution of Delhi's real GSDP to GDP at the national level has increased from 3.94 percent in 2011-12 to 4.21 percent in 2021-22, whereas Delhi is only 1.52 percent of the total population of the country.

Delhi's per capita income is likely to increase to Rs 4,01,982 at current prices in 2021-22. In 2020-21, it was Rs 3,44,136, which is an increase of 16.81 per cent in per capita income in 2021-22.

The Revised Budget Estimate for 2021-22 is Rs 67,000 crore against the approved Budget Estimate of Rs 69,000 crore. The proposed Revised Estimates of Rs 67,000 crore is 27.70 per cent higher than the actual expenditure of Rs 52,468 crore in 2020-22
Sisodia said that prior to the Arvind Kejriwal government coming to power, the total expenditure of the state government during 2014-15 was Rs 30,940 crore. “I presented my first full budget in June 2015 with an estimated expenditure of Rs 41,129 crore,” he said.

The proposed Budget Estimate for 2022-23 is Rs 75,800 crore, 9.86 per cent higher than the Budget Estimate of Rs 69,000 crore for 2021-22 and 13.13 per cent higher than the Revised Estimates. The budget of Rs 75,800 crore for 2022-23 is about two-and-a-half times the expenditure of Rs 30,940 crore in 2014-15.

In Budget Estimates 2022-23 as compared to 2021-22, capital budget has been increased by 29 per cent, while revenue expenditure has increased by only four percent.

“In the budget proposals and schemes presented in this House in the past seven years, the priority was on education and health and it is due to this reason that Delhi has witnessed visionary investments in education and health. Now I want to present the important section of our 'Rozgar Budget' containing 20 lakh new jobs. In this, I will put plans to take the economy of Delhi on the path of progress and generate lakhs of employment opportunities out of this progress,” Sisodia said.

He said the aim is to increase the percentage of the working population of Delhi from the current 33 per cent to 45 per cent in the next five years.

The government has chosen the sectors of retail, food and beverages, logistics and supply chain, travel and tourism, entertainment, construction, real estate and green energy as priority areas where employment can be increased.

“We plan to redevelop and transform the iconic markets of Delhi into attractive tourist destinations.  For this, we propose Rs 100 crore in the budget. At least 1.5 lakh new job opportunities will be created in the next five years from within just five markets,” Sisodia said.

The government plans to hold a 'Delhi Shopping Festival' as also a 'Delhi Wholesale Shopping Festival'.

679,679," U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing an official investigation into whether he or his party broke election law by failing to declare the funding of works to refurbish  his government residence., The Electoral Commission, which regulates political donations, announced the inquiry amid questions over whether Johnson took an undeclared loan from a political donor to cover the costs of refitting his Downing Street apartment., The probe is a blow to the prime minister coming just eight days before local elections across country, deepening the crisis over allegations of sleaze swirling around his administration., “We are now satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offense or offenses may have occurred,” a spokesman for the commission said. “We will therefore continue this work as a formal investigation to establish whether this is the case.”, Possible sanctions available to the watchdog include criminal proceedings and fines of as much as 20,000 pounds ($27,800), depending on the rules found to have been broken., During heated exchanges in Parliament, Johnson denied that any laws had been broken and insisted he had done nothing wrong. “I paid for the Downing Street refurbishment personally,” he said., He was asked three times by opposition leader Keir Starmer to say who had covered the costs of the initial invoice for the work, but declined to name anyone., The inquiry follows weeks of media speculation about who paid for the renovations to Johnson’s apartment and when, as well as a litany of criticism over the premier’s way of handling himself and his administration., Under election laws, donations and loans to political parties and politicians need to be declared within 28 days. Johnson’s office has been facing questions over whether he used a loan from Conservative donors to pay for the refit of his residence last year -- and whether he disclosed the funding properly to regulators., The Electoral Commission, which is independent of government, said its probe will rule on whether transactions related to the refurbishment work in Downing Street fall within its remit, “and whether such funding was reported as required.”, The controversy exploded on Friday when Johnson’s former aide Dominic Cummings went public with claims that the premier tried to get party donors to pay for redecorating the apartment., Johnson’s alleged plan would have been “unethical, foolish, possibly illegal and almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations,” Cummings wrote in an incendiary , ., Prime ministers are allowed to spend 30,000 pounds of public funds a year on refurbishing their official residence, but newspapers have reported costs of as much as 200,000 pounds. The government has said Johnson paid for the works out of his own pocket -- but questions remain about whether undeclared donations were initially used before Johnson stepped in., The government also announced that Christopher Geidt, a former private secretary to Queen Elizabeth II who is now a member of the House of Lords, will be Johnson’s new “independent adviser” on ministers’ interests., “The prime minister and Lord Geidt have agreed that Lord Geidt will begin by ascertaining the facts surrounding the refurbishment of the Downing Street flat, and advise the prime minister on any further registration of interests that may be needed,” the government said in a statement., Johnson’s official spokesman Max Blain said it would be ,  the premier to decide whether to accept or reject Geidt’s findings. Johnson’s press secretary said the prime minister has not yet been asked to give any information to the watchdog but will cooperate if he is., In a statement, a spokesperson for the Conservatives promised the party would continue to “work constructively” with the commission. “We believe all reportable donations have been transparently and correctly declared and published by the Electoral Commission,” the spokesperson said., ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center
414,414," A much-anticipated selloff in China’s bond market, the world’s second largest, may not have materialized yet, but it is on its way if key indicators are any guide., Producer prices are surging, activity gauges are on the rise and foreign bond buying has ground to a halt. What’s more, swap markets signal tighter liquidity., All of this spells higher bond yields. Traders who had ,  for a supply deluge in April that would have hurt China’s bond markets now face the risk of a crunch for yields this month., Here are four charts that show how the pressure is building:, China’s bond market has a habit of lagging behind economic indicators and an alternative gauge based on Premier Li Keqiang’s insights shows how much catching up may lie in store., The index of bank loans, electricity production and rail freight volume has popped to the highest levels since 2010. The move is particularly notable given how closely the gauge correlates with the nation’s five-year non-deliverable interest rate swap, pointing to higher rates in the near term., Producer prices, which have demonstrated a stronger link to Chinese government bond yields than consumer prices, are running red hot. While the surge is due in part to the low base effect from last year, there is still room for acceleration given the sharp increases in the cost of commodity inputs for the nation’s manufacturers. The next installment for the data is due on May 11., Foreign buying of Chinese bonds took a breather in March, according to the most recent ,  from ChinaBond. With global funds trimming holdings by 16.5 billion yuan ($2.5 billion), the drop-off in demand suggests high yields may be in order to entice buyers back., The spread between China’s 10-year bond and similar maturity Treasuries has narrowed to around 160 basis points, from a record of more than 250 basis points in November. China’s 10-year yield closed at 3.15% on Thursday., The slower-than-expected inclusion in FTSE Russell’s flagship global bond index -- over three years instead of 12 months -- reinforces this over the short term., Short-dated interest rate markets in China are starting to taking notice, and they’re pointing to tighter liquidity coming soon., The current three-month swap sits around 2.31%, though one that begins in three months is 12 basis points higher. This shows markets are getting ready for less liquidity, though this hasn’t reverberated out the yield curve yet., ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center
1684,1684,"A fierce attack was made against the Congress party by BJP President Amit Shah in Telangana yesterday, where he announced that by the time the 2019 elections are over, the Congress party will be reduced to almost nothing.

Shah, taking a jibe at Rahul Gandhi stated that the Congress President will have to use a telescope in order to search for his beloved party after the elections. Shah was addressing a public gathering of Bjp’ s Yuva Morcha in its National Maha Adhiveshan in Hyderabad yesterday.

Further continuing his speech, Amit Shah also stated that in case the Congress president had been vividly dreaming of winning the elections this time, he must be reminded of the history of massive support that the BJP has garnered since 2014.

Shah also pointed out that how unaware and ignorant the Congress has been towards the BJP’s accomplishments and could only dream of winning the elections. Referring to the speculations of a grand alliance of opposition parties, Shah told that even the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ will not have any effect on BJP’s winning spree.

Amit Shah also took a jibe at Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati scheming to form an alliance for the 2019 general elections. Shah declared amidst a loud applause that the BJP Yuva Morcha will brave fight 50% of the party’s fight and ensure its victory.

Addressing the Vijay Lakshya 2019, Yuva Maha Adhiveshan in Hyderabad, the BJP chief further stated that after the humiliating defeat that Congress faced in 2014 if Rahul is still hoping for a Congress victory in 2019, that is nothing but dreaming and his party will be reduced to inconsequential levels after 2019.

The state of Telangana will be holding assembly elections on 7 December 2018 along with Rajasthan. Though the BJP is yet to declare a CM candidate, popular Hindu spiritual leader Swami Paripoornananda has recently joined BJP and is being mentioned by many as the ‘Yogi of the South’.

1355,1355,"UP: Is a Modi–Yogi rift at the root of the Rajputs' upset, the Jats' dilemma?
As western Uttar Pradesh gears up for the polls, could the Prime Minister's beef with chief minister Adityanath cost the BJP the Rajput votes?             The powerful Rajputs are an incensed lot today. They believe the BJP is deliberately undermining them and, even worse, trying to edge them out of power. The fact that the party has denied Rajput leaders Lok Sabha tickets in western Uttar Pradesh, from Ghaziabad right up to Saharanpur, has reinforced this belief.

That Prime Minister Narendra Modi cold-shouldered UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath—even as he shook hands with others on the dais—while kickstarting his parliamentary campaign in Meerut has not gone unnoticed. The Rajputs, we hear, see this as a direct insult to the most prominent member of their community.

The recent comments of veteran BJP leader Parshottam Rupala, the BJP’s candidate from Rajkot in Gujarat, who is known to be close to Prime Minister Modi, are being seen as more evidence of a deliberate attempt to belittle the Rajputs.

Rupala had the community up in arms when he said that Rajput rulers had collaborated with the British and were not averse to using their women in “inappropriate ways”. The community, which places its honour above everything, was so shocked that a Kshatriya BJP leader, Raj Shekhawat, resigned from the party on the spot.

The humiliated Rajputs organised a mahapanchayat in Nanauta, in Saharanpur district, on 7 April, held under the Kshatriya Swabhimaan Mahakumbh banner, to salvage their pride. Not just UP, members from as far afield as Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Uttarakhand gathered. It was claimed at the gathering that 80 of the Rajput brethren had been denied tickets across these states.

A full day of deliberations was followed by a clarion call to fight the BJP tooth and nail. The Rajputs would put up their own candidates independently for several seats and would lend their support to the Opposition for the rest.               Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddh Nagar are two of the constituencies where Rajput candidates stand as Independents, in open defiance of the BJP. But will the entire community be willing to adopt this anti-BJP stance?

The candidate from Ghaziabad is Nand Kishore, while Rajinder Solanki stands from Gautam Buddh Nagar. Their candidacy was announced late, the BJP already having launched a strong campaign here and Modi having led a road show in Ghaziabad last week. But the 6 lakh-strong Rajput community in Ghaziabad are in a confrontational mood. They are determined to up the ante against the Modi government that overlooked the Rajputs to give a ticket to Atul Kumar Garg, of the Baniya community.

The Ghaziabad Lok Sabha seat has five Assembly constituencies—Loni, Muradnagar, Sahibabad, Ghaziabad and Dholana.

Sudhir Pandhir, a resident of Ghaziabad, says, “Garg’s track record as an MLA is extremely poor. He is very wealthy and runs several educational institutions, but he has not worked towards improving the government-run institutions. An MLA for the past five years, he has not attended to the grievances of the residents.’’

Prior to the Nanauta meeting, the Rajput community gathered for a mahapanchayat in Chaubisi to express their unhappiness at Gen. V.K. Singh (retd) having been denied a ticket. Chaubisi is part of the Ghaziabad constituency. The BJP leadership has chosen to deliberately break with the tradition of giving this seat to another Rajput leader, despite the constituency sending up a winning Rajput candidate for the last two decades.                          
A Rajput teacher in a private school who did not wish to be named said, “We all know why our community is being marginalised. Modi wants to clip the wings of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who is a Thakur. Yogi is popular and that is his undoing. Modi sees him as a threat and so wants to weaken us as a whole so that no alternative power centre can emerge within the party.”             The public at large, including the majority of Rajputs in and around Ghaziabad, seem to have no beef with Gen. V.K. Singh being denied a third term in Parliament, however.

“He (Gen. Singh) never visited his constituency to partake in our sukh-dukh (joys or sorrows). We would invite him and, despite being so close to Delhi, he made no attempt to visit us. If we took a delegation to his official residence or office, he did not care to interact with us and has done little work for this constituency,” says Ganga Singh, a small farmer living in the outskirts of this city.

It’s only what his rejection means as a token insult to the Rajputs that has their backs up.

The present defence minister, Rajnath Singh, who has completed two parliamentary terms from Ghaziabad, is spoken of with much more respect. Even so, residents of the city with a population of some 6–7 lakh— squeezed between Modinagar to the north, Bulandshahr to the west and Delhi to its east—continue to be deprived of basic facilities, the most significant being the lack of a state-of-the-art government hospital. That’s what they would vote for.

Avinash Chauhan, a salesman from semi-urban Sahibabad, also complains of the non-existent medical facilities in his town. “Despite having such luminaries as our MPs, we have no good government hospital to date,” says Chauhan, “and the private hospitals are unaffordable. The public has no choice but to rush the patient to a government hospital in Delhi in case of an emergency. At least there they get proper treatment free of cost.”

Chauhan works as a shop assistant in a hardware shop owned by a Jat businessman, Mahesh Chaudhary. Chaudhary’s comment on the current political scenario: “We Jats have been traditionally opposed to the BJP. But our leader Jayant Chaudhary has switched over to the BJP and so we will vote for the saffron party now.”

Does he support Jayant Singh’s switchover, then? Chaudhary is silent for a while before saying, “He is following in his father’s footsteps. Everyone has to survive. I supposed he had no choice.”

But at Nanauta, there was strong opposition to the Jats being favoured in seat allocations across western UP, even in constituencies where they did not historically have a strong presence. Will this cause a blowback?

According to Pushpendra Rana, an anthropology scholar from Barkatullah University, the Ghaziabad constituency has about 5.5 lakh Muslims, 5.7 lakh Rajputs, 4.5 lakh Brahmins, 2.5 lakh Baniyas, 4.5 lakh Scheduled Caste citizens, 1.25 lakh Jats, 1 lakh Punjabis, 75,000 Tyagis, 70,000 Gurjars, and 5 lakh other voters. Rana expresses surprise that despite it being a Rajput citadel for many decades, the BJP has decided to field a Baniya candidate here.          Even local BJP leaders seem to be taken by surprise. They thought Ghaziabad was a safe seat, in the bag already, as it were! In the 2014 election, Gen V.K. Singh had secured a historic 7,58,482 votes and defeated the Congress’ Raj Babbar by a margin of over 5.67 lakh votes. In 2019 again, the General defeated Suresh Bansal of the Samajwadi Party by a margin of over 5.1 lakh votes.

One prominent BJP leader, however, dismissed the purported communal tensions: “These mahapanchayats are being organised at the behest of Yogi Adityanath. He wants to undermine Modi’s leadership.”

But the Rajput community’s hurt pride seems palpable: “They came to power invoking the names of our leaders, including Prithviraj Chauhan. They seem to forget that Lord Ram was born in a Kshatriya family. Now they want to sideline us completely.”

Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddh Nagar and Meerut are going to polls on 26 April; Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar and a few others will be done by 19 April. The next Rajput mahapanchayat is scheduled for 16 April in Khera village in Sardhana, which falls under Muzaffarnagar Lok Sabha seat.",Left

467,467," , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s fiscal ,  could reduce Canada’s future spending capacity by leaving debt at elevated levels for decades, according to the nation’s budget watchdog., In a ,  published Wednesday, the Parliamentary Budget Officer warned that the government’s plan would see Canada’s ratio of debt-to-gross domestic product remain higher that it was before the pandemic through 2055., “This suggests that the government has decided to effectively stabilize the federal debt ratio at a higher level, potentially exhausting its fiscal room over the medium- and long-term,” the PBO said. That will require governments in the future to consider tax increases or spending reductions to pay for new programs, it said., Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland’s budget forecasts debt-to-GDP will peak at 51.2%, then fall to 49.2% within about five years. Before the pandemic, it was around 31%., The document, Canada’s first full fiscal plan in more than two years, outlines a strategy to boost the country’s growth coming out of the pandemic. But Freeland’s budget may well become a campaign platform, as Trudeau is expected to try his luck at regaining his lost parliamentary majority in an election this year., The watchdog also warned the budget estimates “overstate the impact” of stimulus spending on growth over the next three years; C$69.2 billion ($56.4 billion) in stimulus for the 2021-22 fiscal year will boost real GDP growth by about 1% in 2022-23 and 2023-24, the PBO said., Freeland’s office defended its plan as “prudent and responsible,” and reiterated the government would continue to support the economy through a punishing third wave of Covid-19. , “Canada had the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the G-7 entering this global crisis and we maintain that position today,” spokeswoman Katherine Cuplinskas said by email Wednesday, noting that S&P Global Ratings reaffirmed the nation’s AAA status after the budget., While Freeland argues the mounting debt won’t damage Canada’s reputation as a , , criticism has come from prominent quarters  , Mark Carney, the former governor at both the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, described the Liberal government’s spending plan as a “hybrid budget.” He added that it would take more than one budget to fully transition the economy to a more sustainable, and faster-growing, path., “In my judgment, this was a hybrid budget, in that it had to conquer Covid by doing important things on the social side and to start growth.

1243,1243,"Political observers say Muslim voters often decide their support during last three days of campaigning.
PTI
MORADABAD: It is going to be difficult to retain Moradabad Lok Sabha constituency for BJP, which is in a direct contest with Congress due to consolidation of Muslim votes ahead of the April 23 election, saffron party candidate Kunwar Sarvesh Kumar has said.
Kumar, a Thakur, is pitted against Congress's Imran Pratapgarhi, a poet who has often questioned the BJP government through his provocative compositions and fiery speeches.
As the campaigning heats up, SP-BSP-RLD coalition's S T Hasan, a doctor by profession, is also trying to win over the Muslim votes, about 47 per cent of the total 19.41 lakh voters in the constituency. Only the community members have not yet disclosed who they will back this time.
Political observers say Muslim voters often decide their support during last three days of campaigning.
Though Kumar, a political strongman, is well-known in the area, he is unsure about his re-election. ""The election is going to be difficult,"" Kumar told PTI on the phone as he is busy campaigning in interior areas of the constituency.
""The fragmentation of Muslim votes has not happened. The election has become Congress versus BJP,"" he added.
Kumar had been a Member of Legislative Assembly five times from Thakurdwara before he was elected MP from Moradabad in 2014. His son is now an MLA from Barhapur, one of the five assembly segments in the parliamentary constituency.
Other than Muslims, Jatavs, who have traditionally supported the BSP, constitute 9 per cent of the total voters.
""We follow wishes of Behan Mayawati ji. Now that an alliance is in place, BSP voters(Jatavs) will give full support to it as is wished by Behenji,"" Ranvijay, a BSP supporter, said.
The BJP is on the defensive as its voters from the Scheduled Caste community — the Balmikis — are also angry with their local MP, Kumar.
They say they will either support the BSP-SP-RLD alliance or not cast their vote.
""We have traditionally voted for the Congress and then we supported the BJP. Our support resulted in the victory of Kumar (in 2014). But in the last five years he has not visited us,"" said Harkesh, a resident of Daulat Bagh Balmiki colony.
He said whenever the community sought Kumar's presence, he sent his representatives. ""We will not vote for him this time.""
Several other people from the community shared the sentiment.
Hasan, 55, meanwhile, has provided treatment to the poor and thinks it will work for him.
In 17 elections since 1952, Muslim candidates have won the seat 11 times, fighting on tickets from every major political party except the BJP.
The Bharatiya Jana Sangh had won the seat twice and the BJP had its first victory in 2014, when a division of Muslim votes between Hasan and Haji Mohammad Yaqoob helped Kumar win the seat.
He had managed 4.85 lakh votes against Hasan (3.97 lakh) and Yaqoob (1.60 lakh). If SP and BSP's votes for 2014 were to be combined, they would have defeated the BJP by a margin of over 75,000 votes.
However, the distribution of Muslim votes among the parties has not been consistent. A lot depends on the candidate.
In 2009, cricketer Mohammad Azharuddin fought as a Congress candidate and managed over three lakh votes, ending a 25-year drought for the party in this constituency.
This time when Congress gave ticket to Raj Babbar from the seat initially, there was an overwhelming feeling in the local unit the party will comfortably win the seat with support from both Hindus and Muslims.
But Babbar distanced himself from the race, bringing Pratapgarhi, the poet who has questioned the government on incidents of lynching and over the missing JNU student Najeeb.
""There had been minor differences over Imran Pratapgarhi's nomination but now we have assuaged everyone and we are working as a team to ensure his win. Muslim votes are fully intact and they will go with the person whom they think is a better candidate. There will be no division of Muslim votes,"" District Congress Committee chief A P Singh told PTI.
Even supporters of the BJP candidate, Kumar, concede that young Muslim men and women find Pratapgarhi's oratory appealing and are getting swayed by him.
Unlike BJP's Kumar, Pratapgarhi and Hasan have been focussing on subtle messaging through community meetings.
The BJP, on the other hand, has organised big campaign rallies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP chief Amit Shah and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Moradabad.
There was a buzz that Qureshis, the second influential caste in Muslim community after Ansaris in Moradabad, may switch to Pratapgarhi, after the SP-BSP coalition cut the ticket of meat businessman Haji Nasir Qureshi, a former BSP member, replacing him with Hasan.
""No. Muslims will not divide their vote. Qureshi had contested on BSP ticket in assembly election. He was new to SP. Local leaders supported Hasan who was the runner-up in local elections. They will vote either of the two candidates,"" Ranvijay, the BSP supporter, said.
The support of Jatavs to the alliance is a major factor convincing Muslims to also vote for it, he said.
""They are seeing this poll as between Prime Minister Modi and Rahul Gandhi. They wanted to support Congress when Raj Babbar was given ticket. But with change in candidate they are realigning their strategy as Jatavs will be supporting the alliance,"" Azam Ansari, a Congress office-bearer, claimed.
It will not be the 45-per cent Muslim vote but the 9-per cent Jatav vote that will be the key, Syed Ganim Mian, who runs a society for brass artisans, said.

1090,1090,"Senior Karnataka BJP leader and former union minister Basanagouda Patil Yatnal has alleged that the ruling party is involved in another scam similar to the Valmiki Corporation ‘scandal.’ The new controversy revolves around the allocation of ₹600 crore to the Karnataka State Habitat Centre in Bengaluru.

The organisation, which is authorised to execute projects under the leadership of Minister Zameer Ahmed, apparently lacks constitutional recognition and violates the Karnataka State Transparency Act.

Yatnal posted on social media platform X: “This Habitat Centre is neither a government entity nor are its employees government officials; the entire set-up is an illusion. Additionally, funds have been transferred to this Habitat Centre from the Kalyana Karnataka Development Board.”

He also accused the organisation of undertaking projects for the Minority Welfare Department and indicated possible collusion between the Minister and officials.

“Since the irregularities in the Valmiki Corporation were exposed, Minister Zameer has been conducting daily meetings at this Habitat Centre to cover up something,” he said.

‘Proof’ sought’
However, the ruling Congress party in the State strongly refuted the allegations. “What proof does Basanagouda Patil have regarding this? Please ask him to present the documents indicating the same,” said a Congress spokesperson speaking to businessline.

Meanwhile Karnataka BJP President and MLA BY Vijayendra said that BJP MLAs and upper house members will stage an overnight sit-in in the State assembly and legislative council since they were not allowed to discuss the MUDA scam in the Assembly.

760,760," A top Chinese diplomat claimed that China is a democracy, arguing its political system exemplifies the ideals of former U.S. president Abraham Lincoln and the ancient Greeks who invented a representative form of government., Qin Gang, China’s ambassador to the U.S., on Wednesday cited the right of Chinese people to participate in certain elections and consultations over major policies as evidence of a democratic system not unlike that in America., “Isn’t it obvious that both China’s people-center philosophy and President Lincoln’s ‘of the people, by the people, for the people’ are for the sake of the people?” Qin ,  in a virtual conference organized by U.S. think tanks The Carter Center and The George H.W.

Chinese diplomats have frequently argued that the values of some Western countries, such as the U.S. and Japan, “don’t represent the international community.” , The comments sought to focus on similarities between the world’s biggest economies as they spar over everything from imports of advanced technology to forced labor allegations in Xinjiang to democracy in Hong Kong. Qin said Washington must act first to improve ties and “lift up the iron curtain” thwarting exchanges between U.S. and Chinese students, academics and artists. , He urged the U.S. to adopt a less hostile strategy toward working with China while calling for “strategic courage and political resolve to chart a new course in China-U.S. relations.”, Xi first ,  used the phrase “whole-process democracy” in 2019 to describe how the government listens to voices outside the party, and it has since gained traction in official rhetoric. Traditionally, more obviously Marxist terms such as “democratic dictatorship” and “socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics” have distinguished the Chinese political system from Western liberal democracy, in which election outcomes aren’t preordained. , Qin also said the Communist Party had the popular support of “over 90%” of the Chinese people, without mentioning that it routinely jails critics and dissidents. He heaped praise on Xi, who  in 2018 oversaw a move to scrap presidential term limits that had been in place for more than three decades. , Xi’s rise from “a farmer in a poor village” to work his way through the party ranks, Qin said, was an embodiment of Greek philosopher Plato’s vision that “prime ministers must have served as local officials.” He did not mention that Xi’s father, Xi Zhongxun, was a CCP revolutionary who fought alongside the party’s founding father Mao Zedong. , Xi “is loved, trusted and supported by the people,” Qin said. “This is why you often find China’s senior officials elected with an overwhelming majority of votes or even unanimously.”, ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center
1459,1459,"One of the greatest men of independent India breathed his last on the 16th of August, 2018. Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a giant among mere mortals, was a politician who led India through one of the most critical times in its history to usher in a new era of prosperity. As politicians across the spectrum gathered to mourn the memory of the Hindutva stalwart, it was inevitable that there would be some elements who would try their best to tarnish the solemn moment with their words worthy of much disgust. There was a certain section of the media which was under the impression that it was a good idea to use the death of Vajpayee to shower more adulation on the Gandhis, the same Vajpayee whose contribution was enormous towards the undermining of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. Then there were those who were rejoicing at the prospect of Vajpayee’s imminent death and could not hide their hatred for the man even at such an inappropriate moment. Then there were outlets such as The Wire which immediately took it upon itself to pass moral judgments on Vajpayee and brand him a communal bigot. There were much more repulsive posts on the death of Vajpayee which I chose not to quote here but it’s clear that the visceral hatred that those on the Left bear for him is quite out of order. Vajpayee is hated because he is one of the great success stories of Hindutva and is evidence of the fact that a Hindutva Sarkar could provide better governance and lead the country to greater heights than corrupt ‘secular’ parties which indulged in blatant minority appeasement. Vajpayee was the great Hindutvawadi under whose leadership India became a nuclear power and sailed through a period of sanctions without suffering any misery as such. And more importantly, he was a visionary who added new chapters to the Indian growth story which began earlier under the leadership of PV Narasimha Rao. And these are hard pills for the Left to swallow who have demonstrated time and again that their only legacy when it comes to governance is running a state to the ground. The people who are too busy spewing hate against Vajpayee are unsurprisingly the same who believe Aurangzeb was a benevolent ruler and that his persecution of Hindus must be seen from a certain context. The “Liberal” Left hates him for his involvement in the Ram Janambhoomi movement but conveniently chooses to ignore the context under which the vents that transpired developed. A thing that becomes clear after a while is that the Left hates Vajpayee for pretty much the same reasons for which the Right respects and adores him. The Ram Janambhoomi movement, Pokhran, his economic policies and his avowed commitment to Hindutva are what makes Vajpayee so loved among the Right and hated among the Left. And the death of Vajpayee is illuminating once again these irreconcilable differences that have come to the forefront of Indian politics in 2018. The Left betrays its own words with its actions. They preach tolerance and coexistence and rational discussion and yet they do not hesitate to spit on the memory of a former Prime Minister who improved India’s fortunes greatly for the better. They accuse the Right of being filled with hatred and yet, it is they whose minds have been so corrupted with rage that they have forsaken all decency and chosen to spew hatred against a man who hadn’t even been cremated yet. If democratic politics is to succeed, it is essential that certain courtesies are observed by all sides on certain occasions. However, it has become clear that the Left is incapable of observing such common decencies and offer the most minimum of courtesies to a Hindu because they have been consumed by hatred. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a true son of the soil. His speech on Savarkar is still relevant to this day. We have to remember that Vajpayee isn’t hated for things he did or things he chose not to do. He is hated because of his identity and because he is a Hindutvawadi. The Left has made it abundantly clear that they will reserve nothing but only hatred and scorn for a Hindutvawadi, even in death, ignoring all the greatness that the Hindutvawadi was endowed with. The legacy of Vajpayee is a refutation of the narrative that the Left had carefully crafted over the years that a Sanghi cannot provide effective governance to a 21st century India. The Left describes Hindus as being stuck up over past glories and incapable of charting a bright future ahead and yet it was Vajpayee, the Hindutvawadi, who established India as a nuclear power. The Left would have us believe that Hindu thought is incapable of producing visionary leaders and yet it was Vajpayee, the Hindutvawadi, who envisioned the Golden Quadrilateral and heralded an era of economic prosperity. The Hindutva of Vajpayee was a slap on the face of Nehruvian Socialism and its glories that the Left had come to glorify and that is why he is so reviled even in death. Narendra Modi is only carrying forward the legacy of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He appears to have learnt from the mistakes the late stalwart of Hindutva committed and is working towards fulfilling the dreams and ambition of the now deceased former Prime Minister. Certain sections of the media may now be showering praise on him to further their own political objective of criticizing Narendra Modi but Atal Bihari Vajpayee was hated just as much during his Prime Ministerial tenure as Modi is hated now. At least the section of the political spectrum still showering hate on Vajpayee are consistent with their approach towards the man but worse are the hypocrites who are using his death to attack Narendra Modi, a man after Vajpayee’s own heart. It should be clear to Hindus now that it hardly matters how they conduct themselves in public life. If they believe that the Mughals were tyrants whose symbols of oppression should eradicated from the face of Bharata, if they believe that Babri was a symbol of tyranny and a testament to Islamic intolerance, if they believe that a bhavya Ram Mandir is of utmost import to initiate the spiritual awakening of Bharata and most importantly, if they believe that they have the right to defend themselves from Islamic aggression should the state fail to do so, then they will be hated and reviled by the Left because there’s nothing on the face of the Earth the Left hates more than the unending resilience of the great Hindu Civilization.",Right
1742,1742,"Rahul Gandhi on Ram, Sita, BJP-RSS—and living the true Hindu life
Sita may be inseparable from Ram, but she has no place in a patriarchal Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s scheme of things                     The following translated excerpts from Rahul Gandhi's speeches during the 2022-23 Bharat Jodo Yatra have been taken from Dayashankar Mishra's self-published book Rahul Gandhi: Sampradayikta, Dushprachar, Tanashahi se Aitihasik Sangharsh.

Excerpts from the speech at a rally in Agar-Malwa, Madhya Pradesh on 2 December 2022

During the yatra, I met many people. A pandit ji came to see me, and raised a very deep question, which he then proceeded to explain. He said, “Rahul ji, he who was Lord Ram, was an ascetic. He devoted his entire life to penance.” Quite right.

Then he said, “Gandhiji used to say ‘Hey Ram!’ Gandhiji’s slogan was ‘Hey Ram!’ What does ‘Hey Ram’ mean?” After a brief silence, he said, “The meaning of ‘Hey Ram’ is… Lord Ram was not just a person, he was a way of life full of love, brotherhood, respect and penance. He showed the whole world the way to live. And every time Gandhiji said ‘Hey Ram!’ he meant that the feeling that is Lord Ram is present in our hearts. And that feeling should guide our lives. In other words, to live one’s life by doing the kind of penance Lord Ram did, serving society the way he did, spreading love and brotherhood the way he did.                   ""Next, there’s ‘Jai Siyaram’. What might ‘Jai Siyaram’ mean? Panditji told me this as well. I learned so much in course of the yatra. It means simply that Sita and Ram are one. Hence the slogan, ‘Jai Siyaram’ or ‘Jai Sitaram’. Meaning Ram’s way of life, the things he did for Sita. And what did Lord Ram do for Sita? Don’t you know that? He went and fought for her honour. So, when we say ‘Jai Siyaram’, we remember Sita and honour her rightful place in society. Correct? So that’s ‘Jai Siyaram’ or ‘Jai Sitaram’. There’s a third slogan: ‘Jai Shri Ram’. That’s where we praise Lord Ram.""

Pandit ji asked me to raise this question in my speech: Why do the BJP people raise the slogan ‘Jai Shri Ram’ but never say ‘Jai Siyaram’ or ‘Hey Ram’?""

I liked that a lot, as pandit ji had revealed a very deep thing to me. The RSS and BJP people do not live their lives the way Ram lived his life. Ram was not unjust to anyone. He worked to unite society. He was respectful towards everyone. Lord Ram helped farmers, labourers, traders, everyone. Right? His philosophy, his spirit, his way of life — that has not been adopted by the RSS and BJP people.

And the second slogan, ‘Jai Siyaram’, is perhaps the most important slogan of all. But how can they say ‘Jai Siyaram’ when there is not a single woman in their organisation! It is not a ‘Jai Siyaram’ organisation because women cannot join it. Sita cannot even think of being part of it. Sita has been excluded.
         This deep truth was revealed to me by a pandit ji from Madhya Pradesh as I travelled down this very road. Now, I want to say to our friends in the RSS, “Use all three slogans — ‘Jai Shri Ram’, ‘Jai Siyaram’ and ‘Hey Ram’ — and please don’t insult Sita ji.""

Do you recall the picture of Ram Darbar, depicting maryada purushottam Ram, Lakshman, Sita and Hanuman? This picture, seen in every devout Hindu home, showed Ram carrying his bow slung across his shoulder. For their political purpose, the RSS and BJP use another picture of Lord Ram, in which he stands with his bow raised, aiming at the lord of the sea for obstructing his way to Lanka. He pulls the string. This is the only incident in the life of maryada purushottam where he gives in to wrath. This is the picture of Lord Ram that the RSS and BJP prefer. Where wrath is the central theme.

Similarly, an artist did some artistry with an image of the courageous and calm Hanuman and infused his image with anger. That picture was made the new identity of Bajrang Bali. Plastered on the backs of vehicles, this Hanuman does not look calm or courageous; instead, he looks wrathful. Here too, wrath is the central theme.

Having done with faith, it was now the turn of a national symbol. Spending thousands of crores of rupees, a new parliament house is being built to replace the old one. The name of this project is the Central Vista Renovation Project. An administrative area running all the way from Raisina Hill to India Gate in our capital Delhi.           On the roof of the parliament house in this Central Vista, the Ashoka Pillar, our national symbol, has been installed. This 20-feet-high pillar weighing 9,500 kilos was unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with all the Hindu rites and rituals. Lok Sabha Speaker, Om Birla, was merely marking attendance.

If you look at the pictures of this Ashoka Pillar carefully, you will see that the calm, courageous and patient lions of the original Ashoka Pillar appear ravenous, roaring and enraged. It seems as if the four lions that symbolised strength, courage, confidence and pride have deliberately been depicted in agitated and aggressive mode.            The yatra has now been on the road for 100 days. Through Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. On the way, along with our friends from the press, I see other dear friends. Usually, they happen to be standing atop the BJP offices.

I start off, and there they are, standing with their hands tied. And what do I do? I spot them and I wave at them. They don’t wave back. They keep standing, their hands tied. They keep watching me. They cannot wave a greeting to Rahul Gandhi. They might want to, but they cannot, they do not have permission. I wave some more. One or two wave back. And then I blow them a flying kiss, just as you did...               Sometimes they look at me and gesture a question towards me, because they cannot talk to me, you see! They cannot come to me, that’s forbidden. I don’t hate them. I fight against their ideology. But I like them, as I like all living beings.

And so, they make that questioning gesture with their hands, meaning, “What are you doing? What are you doing?” You’re going from Kanyakumari to Srinagar! Their leaders say, “Why is Rahul Gandhi marching?""

That was on my mind. I thought about it for a while. What was I doing? What am I doing? I am walking. I am meeting people. I am hugging people. What am I doing? And I got my answer.

For their workers, their foot soldiers, for those who wave questioning hands at me and ask, “What are you doing?”, my answer is, “I am opening a ‘shop of love’ in the market of hate.”

Hate me. Abuse me. That’s what’s in your heart. You run a market of hate. I run a shop of love. And I’m not just talking about myself. Don’t think that it’s only Rahul Gandhi who is saying this. It’s all of us, the entire organisation that led our country to freedom.

Who am I? It’s people like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Ambedkar ji, Azad — all of them, each of them, had opened a ‘shop of love’ in the market of hate. That’s what we do. So, this is my answer to all the BJP people. Join us. Start opening ‘shops of love’ in the market of hate. You will, eventually, have to. Because our land, our faith, is one of love and not of hate.

715,715," President Joe Biden told Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday that he intends to recognize the early-20th century massacre of Armenians by Ottoman Empire forces as a genocide, according to people familiar with a call between the leaders., Biden is expected to use the word “genocide” in a statement Saturday recognizing Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day, making good on a promise from his presidential campaign. He would be the first U.S. president in 40 years to publicly recognize the 1915 mass killings as a genocide., The White House did not mention the issue in a statement about Biden’s call with Erdogan, the first of his presidency, saying only that Biden told the Turkish leader that he’s interested in a “constructive bilateral relationship with expanded areas of cooperation and effective management of disagreements.”, They agreed to meet during a NATO summit in Brussels in June, the White House said., The lira extended losses on news of the call, dropping as much as 1% against the dollar. That took this week’s losses to 3.9%, the worst performance among emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the Peruvian sol., A subsequent statement from Erdogan’s office said the Turkish leader raised grievances of his own. Erdogan discussed the U.S. refusal to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in exile in Pennsylvania whom Erdogan accuses of orchestrating a failed 2016 coup. He also raised U.S. support for Kurdish forces in Syria, saying both matters “were important to advancing Turkey-U.S. relations,” according to Erdogan’s office., Ronald Reagan was the last U.S. president to call the atrocities committed against the Armenians a “genocide,” in 1981, but he soon backtracked under pressure from Turkey, the successor state to the Ottoman Empire., Erdogan has rebuked other countries that have labeled the executions, deportations and organized massacres of Armenians a genocide, and Biden’s declaration will likely strain relations with the NATO ally., The Armenian diaspora has long lobbied the U.S. government to officially recognize the more than 100-year-old series of atrocities as a genocide., Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told the news site Haberturk this week that Biden’s words had no legal effect and would only harm U.S.-Turkey relations. “If the ,  wants to worsen ties, the decision is theirs,” he said., Relations between the countries are already strained over Turkey’s decision to purchase an air defense system from Russia, which led Donald Trump’s administration to impose unprecedented sanctions against a member of NATO., During last year’s presidential campaign, Biden promised to “recognize the Armenian Genocide and make universal human rights a top priority.”, Still, it was not a foregone conclusion Biden would use the word in an official statement. President Barack Obama made a similar promise in 2008. But in eight years in office, he issued only watered-down statements calling the events of 1915 “a tragedy” a “mass atrocity” and a “horror” — but not a genocide., In 2019, both houses of Congress adopted a resolution recognizing the genocide. That vote occurred amid the dispute over the anti-aircraft missiles and after Turkey began a military campaign in northern Syria, following Trump’s decision to abruptly withdraw U.S. troops from the Kurdish-held region., Earlier that year, Erdogan had blamed Armenians for the events of 1915, saying in a Twitter post that “the relocation of the Armenian gangs and their supporters, who massacred the Muslim people, including women and children, in eastern Anatolia, was the most reasonable action that could be taken in such a period.”, ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center
319,319,"(Bloomberg) -- Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said he believes Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s final report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election should be publicly released, a commitment that President Donald Trump’s new attorney general has refused to make., “I think that report should be shared immediately with Congress, and I think it should be shared as broadly as possible with the American public,” McCabe said in an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program Wednesday., Mueller is due to submit conclusions explaining his decisions to prosecute or decline filing charges to new Attorney General William Barr, who was sworn in last week. Barr will decide what to do with that information., During his Senate , , Barr -- who described Mueller as a longtime close friend -- refused to commit to sharing the special counsel’s findings with Congress and the public. He said regulations call for Mueller’s report to be confidential, and “the report that goes public would be a report by the attorney general.” He also suggested he might exclude criticism of Trump from any such public report in light of the Justice Department’s policy that a president can’t be indicted while in office., McCabe, who is promoting a new book, told CNN Tuesday night that “it’s possible” Trump is working as a Russian “asset.” McCabe said officials began the investigation into whether Trump and his campaign had been colluding with Russia in the days after the president fired FBI director James Comey in May of 2017., McCabe, who served as acting director after Comey’s firing, said he briefed top congressional leaders -- known as the “Gang of Eight” -- about the Trump probe at the time., “The most important thing is that people should be confident that what they ultimately hear from Director Mueller and his team is the honest, straight-up, complete result of the investigation that they did -- whether it finds the smoking guns that you think might be there, or nothing at all,” McCabe said in the interview. “I know from working with Director Mueller over the course of about 12 years that he is perfectly equipped to do this job -- he’ll do it thoroughly, honestly and independently.”, Trump ripped McCabe on Wednesday, likening him to former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the longest-serving director of the agency who was often accused of abuses of power., “Andrew McCabe has made a fool out of himself over the last couple of days and he really looks to me like sort of a poor man’s J. Edgar Hoover,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “I think he’s a disaster. And what he was trying to do was terrible. And he was caught. I’m very proud to say we caught him.”, McCabe has generated controversy this week by saying he was present in the wake of Comey’s firing when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein brought up the idea of wearing a wire to secretly record Trump as well as the possibility of invoking the Constitution’s 25th Amendment to remove the president on the grounds he was unfit for office. The Justice Department has disputed McCabe’s depiction of the conversations., Trump has been tweeting his outrage over McCabe’s assertions, saying on Monday that he and Rosenstein “were planning a very illegal act, and got caught.”, Rosenstein plans to leave the Justice Department soon. On Tuesday, Trump announced that he intends to nominate Jeffrey Rosen, who’s now deputy secretary of the Transportation Department, to succeed him., While Barr is now in place at the Justice Department, Democrats in Congress have suggested he should recuse himself from overseeing the final phase of Mueller’s investigation, citing a memo he sent to the Justice Department last year criticizing Mueller for looking into Trump’s firing of Comey as possible obstruction of justice., Barr refused in his confirmation hearing last month to commit to recusing himself, saying he’d seek the advice of career ethics officials., ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Left
234,234,"Amid the ongoing turmoil in Bangladesh, where reports of violence, including targeting of minorities, has been reported, various political parties in India have expressed concern, with the statements of some laced with political messaging.

While the Congress has kept its reactions largely general and measured, with a passing mention of minorities, the BJP and the RSS have underlined the threat to “Hindus” and other minorities in Bangladesh. This is in line with the core politics of the BJP and the ideology of the Sangh, where articulating the welfare of Hindus across the world, especially those living in Muslim-dominated countries, is part of core political discourse.

On Friday, RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale issued a statement, asking the Union government to ensure the safety of Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh. “The RSS expresses serious concern over violence against Hindus, Buddhists and other minority communities in Bangladesh during the movement for regime change in the last few days… targeted killings, looting, arson, crimes against Hindu and other minority women, and attacks on Hindu temples are intolerable.” Hosabale said.

Hosabale said he expects the Bangladesh interim government to “immediately stop” such incidents, and requested the global community and all political parties in India to stand in solidarity with persecuted communities, including Hindus and Buddhists, at “this critical time”. Hosabale’s statement comes close on the heels of Modi expressing similar concerns on Thursday. Modi had said: “We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities…”

Reports of attacks on minorities and their places of worship in Bangladesh only bolstered the BJP argument that Hindus were not safe in neighbouring Muslim-dominated countries. This was the fundamental basis on which the government had passed the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in 2019, sparking protests across the country. The legislation was finally implemented just before the Lok Sabha polls this year.The reactions from the Congress have been more measured. In his statement congratulating Yunus, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had said: “We hope that normalcy and peace returns in Bangladesh, with whom we Indians share a historic relationship. We pray for the safety of all the Bangladeshi people, including all the minorities.”

Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s congratulatory message to Yunus only added: “A swift restoration of peace and normalcy is the need of the hour.”

The TMC, which had earlier created a controversy with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee saying she would welcome people from Bangladesh seeking refuge in the country, exercised caution. In her first remarks as the Hasina government unravelled, Banerjee had said that she would back any stand the Centre took. “If our brothers and sisters who are there face some trouble, the government of India and the government of Bangladesh will look into it,” she had said.",Center
1452,1452,"This is surprising. While liberals have roundly criticized the cost of the Statue of Unity and occasionally tried to demean Sardar Patel himself, I had not yet seen a liberal using an expletive for the Iron Man of India. Much less the F**** word which is used here. How could someone hope to get away with such language for a national icon as great as Sardar Patel? That’s when I realized that the video had been posted on the channel “Telesur English” by this Indian liberal. Now if you have never heard of the channel Telesur English, that’s for good reason. Telesur is a giant media network jointly owned by five governments in Latin America and watched by close to 500 million people. Yes, Telesur is often called the “Latin American CNN.” Now that we have an idea of the reach of Telesur, let us find out what these 500 million people are hearing about the Statue of Unity.  What is said next in the video leaves no room for doubt that this is an attack on the character of Sardar Patel himself, not just the cost of building the statue. Here it is: “ So if your government has to spend $430 million, what would you want them to spend it on? Education … or a giant f*cking statue of a right wing bigot? ” Did you hear that? They are calling Sardar Patel a “right wing bigot”. And that’s not all, listen to how they describe the character of our Iron Man: “Patel was instrumental in annexing states which did not want to be a part of India and after annexing a Muslim ruled state, he said, ‘Hindus of Hyderabad became free after many years of bondage and a big tumor was removed from the stomach of India.’” Hear that? Millions of viewers in Latin America are getting this horrible warped picture of India and our history. All thanks to Indian liberals. Now you may ask how it matters if someone in distant Latin America hears this twisted version of Indian history. This is where we might underestimate the evil genius of Indian liberalism and their strategic investments in a global anti-India narrative. You see as India becomes a global economic superpower, our companies, our investors, our professionals will go everywhere. We will have customers from all over the world. Today India might not have significant business interests in Latin America, but what about a decade from now? Indian liberals understand this. So they are reaching out far in advance to these places and salting the earth. Remember that Latin American audience would know almost nothing about India. This twisted “information” about India forcibly annexing “Muslim ruled states” to “liberate Hindus” might be the only thing these people have ever heard about India’s political history. And we all know that first impressions are often the last impressions. A decade later when our businesses and professionals arrive in Latin America, they would be confronted with a populace that thinks we are a bigoted, xenophobic country. This is exactly what the liberals want. They want to stop India’s march towards greatness. Their plan is almost perfect. We Indians don’t watch Latin American media so we don’t know what liberals are up to. But quietly and diligently and behind our backs, liberals are working hard to build an anti-India narrative three continents away. We’ll find out only a decade too late, when we go to do business over there and discover that the common people are already biased against us. So how badly do liberals want to hurt India? How far would they go in their hatred and hypocrisy? The irony is particularly thick in this video because it’s posted by Telesur. I already told you that five governments jointly own Telesur. But did you know that the No. 1 sponsor of Telesur is the government of Venezuela? Yes, that’s the same Venezuela where inflation is at 1 lakh per cent. The same Venezuela whose corrupt government has reduced the population to starvation. Seen here on this bridge is the daily mad rush of Venezuelans seeking asylum in Colombia.",Right
184,184,"World Theatre Day, observed on 27 March, was initiated in 1962. It's meant to serve as a reminder of the importance of the art form of theatre, of its value as an instrument of social change, its power to serve as a wake-up call to governments, societies and authority figures, even individuals.The theatre that doesn't make it to the stage can sometimes be just as powerful as what does.Through 2018, Firstpost ran a series of interviews with Indian playwrights, about the script/s they never managed to bring to stage (or did after a very long struggle). From veterans like Rahul DaCunha and Ramu Ramanathan to voices like Purva Naresh, we found out about plays that had long simmered in their creators' minds (and on the page) but could not be mounted as productions for a variety of reasons.All of these interviews were conducted by journalist Lakshmi Govindrajan Javeri for Firstpost.On World Theatre Day 2019, here's a look at some of them:Rahul DaCunha on I Do and Page 3  two unfinished scripts he hasn't yet given up onBack in 2003-04, Rahul started writing a play titled Page 3. He says,  Reeling from political ineptitude, Mumbai needed a CEO, who would not be aligned to any party, and who would be held accountable like any CEO in a company would. Stemming from this belief, I started writing a play about the marriage of two people inhabiting different worlds: a socialist and a socialite. A friend starts to disrupt the life of the socialist. It was a humour-laced social commentary on the convenience of friendships, relationships and politics. One year into writing Page 3, Rahul found himself at the beginning of his divorce proceedings. Where Page 3 came out of his frustrations of being a citizen in a corrupt city, Rahul found that writing about his emotional situation was cathartic. I Do stemmed from his personal anger at himself, at the system, at where his life was; the writing of which began while he was sitting in the divorce court.Meant to be a one-and-a-half-hour play with no intervals, I Do was about two people sitting in divorce court along with their lawyers as they wait for the judge to arrive. The conversation between the two oscillates from making pointed observations about relationships to acerbic humour about the state of affairs.While Page 3 took the backseat in the process of Rahul s divorce, I Do too reached a stage where the playwright couldn t go further. In drama school, playwrights are often asked what their anger is. The anger, in this case, is the rage or the passion that drives a writer to wake up and write about the issues that matter to him. While Rahul was writing I Do, he got divorced, became friends again with his ex-wife and somehow the anger fizzled out.  When the anger fizzled out, so did the play. I realised at one point that the play needed another angle. At that stage in my life, I couldn t find it. Read the full interview with Rahul DaCunha here.***Purva Naresh on her unfinished Irom Sharmila play: We've already failed her; I can't do it againFor five years, Purva had been gravitating towards writing about Manipuri civil rights and political activist Irom Sharmila.  I was so interested by her life and what she stood for. There was abundant information about her activities in the newspapers. I read up a lot beyond that, had even planned to go and meet her as part of my research. Yet I felt I couldn t crack the idea of the play. If it s based on someone, I don t want it to sound like another adulatory work, or a biography. I wasn t looking to document Irom Sharmila. I was looking to write about what makes her who she is her Irom Sharmila- ness ,  Purva said.Her perspective was well in place but Purva has been keen to not make the play about just Irom Sharmila s struggles or make it a plot-oriented piece of work that strings together incident after incident that shaped the activist s life. How to proceed with the idea of her is fundamental to the writing of the play. Setting the play in the context of contemporary India and giving it a global perspective, Purva is still looking to answer why she would write about Irom Sharmila today. One of the reasons I m stuck with this script is because we as a people have already failed Irom Sharmila once. I can t do that again. I need to have the script right. Read the full interview with Purva Naresh here.***Ramu Ramanathan, raconteur extraordinaire, on the stories he'd love to bring to the stageA story that Ramu Ramanathan wants to write finds its roots in the Mathura rape case of 1972. The story of the custodial rape of a young Adivasi girl by two policemen saw much public anguish. The High Court set aside a sessions court judgment that stated her being habituated to intercourse, therefore making her consent implicit. The High Court held that passively submitting out of fear cannot be construed as consent. While this judgment was historic, the Supreme Court of India s ghastly reversal of the High Court judgment on grounds of no visible signs of struggle, saw the acquittal of the accused. This led to public outcry and gave birth to many women s rights groups whose activists went on to become leading voices in matters of gender equality over the years. Every single time I sat down to write about this, something else was playing on outside that would make me stop. Whether it was the cases of the '90s, the bar dancers in the subsequent decade, or even Nirbhaya, there was something even more horrific happening simultaneously. The idea to write this play was to contextualise the independent women s autonomous movement. Over time the sexual violence of that play got diminished because of what s been happening. One wouldn t want to be seeing as tapping on the hysteria that surrounds such major movements,  he says.Ramanathan has worked out all the characters and situations, with the tone of the play needing some more time and thought. Over three decades, Ramanathan has accumulated copious notes, while meeting extraordinary women who have participated in various movements that sought better rights and justice for women.  It is undoubtedly a play about what happened to Mathura and the aftermath, but it is the kind of atrocity and travesty of justice that has manifested again and again through various instances, each time questioning the middle-class morality of a woman s identity. I ve imagined this play to open with a rock song, because what better than rock to be a voice of protest! Read the complete interview with Ramu Ramanathan here.",Left
1754,1754,"The independent nation has never seen such a sustained political agitation led by young women – vociferously, unfailingly and determinedly. Who are these protesting, shouting and uproarious young women? Are they just students from India’s liberal campuses? Or are they instigated by opponent parties? Is their participation an accident or is there a method in this upheaval? It is neither an accident, nor an instigation. There is a clear and single-minded shift. Female students in university campuses across India are out to show that the future of politics is shifting rapidly; that 21st century politics is not going to be handled by the rhetoric of masculinity anymore; that the time has come to deal in politics with care and concern for gender discourses rather than making that occasional call for for the blood of the rapist. The increasing number of vocal girls is saying that gender-justice is not alms, but a systemic intervention into the nature and logic of politics itself. This is the broad picture generally but there are more nuanced reasons why women are willing to bet themselves at the altar of restive, bloody street politics. First, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) threatens women in a larger way than men. Images and reports of detention camps in Assam have given demonstration to that effect. And women – not only from minorities, but across sections – have started to feel the fear of being disenfranchised. This is a real fear, because suffrage is a key issue for a nation with a colonial past. In a nation like India, where the process of decolonisation is hardly over, the national identity of women emerged out of the construction of history of its struggles against the colonial (and also post-colonial) government. And hence, the threat to lose the right to vote or to get the citizenship nullified makes a deep impact. It is a matter of survival for women in higher studies, who know what it has taken them to have finally found a voice. Therefore, they are are much more keen to resist the law, considering it as one that forecloses a fundamental aspect of gender justice. Second, the fear of adequate documents. In India, women, across various socio-economic markers are often deprived of state papers. Since 1990s, the government’s concern for prenatal and postnatal care in rural areas meant that many were birthed by midwives, complicating birth certification prospects; the rate of marriage registration is still arbitrary; women often do not possess immovable property under their name; and stay at the ‘care’ of father or husband after marriage. Thus, the implementation of CAA and National Register of Citizenship (NRC) are introducing a new order, a new ‘definition of margin’ and a new hegemony, which is posing a grave threat to women across communities, caste and class. And the increasing rural literacy and urban mobility among women are not hiding these dangers anymore from them. These young women are often first generation learners or the first generation in higher studies in their family. For them, being pushed to a state of lack of agency, which they have seen in their mothers or grandmothers is not an option anymore. Hence, anything that threatens the possibility of their aspiration and mobility is making them participate resolutely in protesting against a discriminatory law. Literacy, is in fact, another reason in itself for increased participation of women. The substantive increase of female students in higher education means that girls are now travelling more, staying in hostels and participatory renting, making them independent and in control of their lives. This detachment from family and increased ownership of the self gives courage to speak up, to stand up and to raise voices; even against the state.",Left

66,66,"Nahid Islam, a Gen-Z, Who Changed the whole Politics, Government and History of Bangladesh?                      Nahid Islam, a Gen-Z, Who Changed the whole Politics, Government and History of Bangladesh?                           The Face of the Bangladesh Protests
At the heart of these Bangladesh protests stands Nahid Islam, a 26-year-old sociology student from Dhaka University. Islam emerged as a pivotal figure in the movement, capturing national attention with his vocal criticism of the previous government and his role as a National Coordinator for the ‘Students Against Discrimination’ Movement.                         Often seen in public with a Bangladeshi flag tied across his forehead, Islam quickly became a symbol of the youth-led resistance. His involvement in the Bangladesh protests, however, came at a personal cost. Islam faced multiple arrests and alleged mistreatment by authorities, incidents that only served to intensify public outrage and fuel the growing protest movement.

Background of Nahid Islam
Born in Dhaka in 1998, Islam comes from a middle-class background. His father works as a teacher, while his mother is a homemaker. Islam is married and has a younger brother, Nakib, who is also a student. Despite his young age, Islam has already established himself as a human rights defender, consistently advocating for social justice and democratic reforms.

Origins of the Bangladesh Protests
The Bangladesh protests initially ignited in July, focusing on a controversial job quota system.Many students viewed this system, which reserved up to 30% of government positions for family members of independence war veterans, as discriminatory. They argued that it unfairly benefited supporters of the ruling Awami League party, which had led the independence movement in 1971.

As the Bangladesh protests gained momentum, they began to expose deeper, systemic issues within the country. The demonstrations highlighted the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have been declining and foreign exchange reserves are running low. Moreover, the protests underscored the lack of quality employment opportunities for young graduates, who increasingly seek stable government jobs in a challenging economic climate.

Escalation and Impact of the Bangladesh Protests
The situation took a dramatic turn on July 15 when the Bangladesh protests erupted into violence. Student protesters clashed with security officials and pro-government activists, prompting authorities to respond with severe measures. These included the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and the imposition of curfews with shoot-on-sight orders. Schools were closed, and internet and mobile data services were suspended.

The unrest spread rapidly across the country, resulting in approximately 300 fatalities and thousands of injuries. This period of violence stands as one of the most turbulent in Bangladesh since its war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. The intensity and scale of the Bangladesh protests highlighted the deep-seated frustrations among the populace, particularly the younger generation.

Nahid Islam’s Role and Vision
Throughout the Bangladesh protests, Islam maintained a firm stance against the government. He called pro-government activists ‘terrorists’ and warned that students were ready to escalate their actions if necessary. His unwavering commitment to the cause, even in the face of personal danger, earned him widespread respect among protesters.

Islam proposed that Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus be made the chief adviser to the new government, making a significant move. This suggestion gained traction and ultimately came to fruition. Islam’s influence in shaping the direction of the Bangladesh protests and their aftermath cannot be overstated.

With the formation of the interim government, Islam has joined a 16-member advisory council.

International Perspective
The events in Bangladesh have caught the attention of international observers. Sabrina Karim, an associate professor of government at Cornell University specializing in political violence, described the outcome of the Bangladesh protests as potentially “the first successful Gen Z-led revolution.” This perspective underscores the significant role that young people played in bringing about political change in Bangladesh.

Looking Ahead
As Bangladesh navigates this period of transition, the impact of the protests continues to reverberate through the nation’s political and social fabric. The involvement of youth leaders like Nahid Islam in the",Left

1313,1313,"PM Modi appropriating flag that RSS disowned: Congress on 'Har Ghar Tiranga'
In 2015, RSS said ""saffron should have been the only colour on the national flag as other colours represented a communal thought"": Ramesh                               The Congress on Saturday, 10 August, took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his appeal to people for the ""Har Ghar Tiranga"" campaign, alleging that he is attempting to appropriate a national symbol that ""RSS has long disowned"".

Prime Minister Modi on Friday asked people to make the ""Har Ghar Tiranga"" campaign a memorable mass movement as he replaced his profile picture on X with the national flag and urged everyone to do the same.

Noting Modi's ""Har Ghar Tiranga"" campaign, Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh shared on X what he said is a ""short history of the RSS's relationship with the Tiranga"".

""M.S. Golwalkar, the second chief of the RSS, in his book Bunch of Thoughts had criticised the Congress' decision to adopt the Tricolour as the national flag, labelling it 'communal' and 'a case of drifting and imitating',"" Ramesh said.                  ""The RSS mouthpiece, Organiser, in 1947 wrote that the Tricolour 'will never be respected and owned by Hindus. The word three is in itself an evil, and a flag having three colours will certainly produce a very bad psychological effect and is injurious to a country',"" he said on X.

Ramesh further said that in 2015, the RSS said that ""saffron should have been the only colour on the national flag as other colours represented a communal thought"".

The RSS did not regularly hoist the Tiranga at its headquarters till 2001, when three youth forcibly hoisted the flag on its premises, a ""crime"" for which they were booked, he said.

""The non-biological Prime Minister is attempting to appropriate this national symbol, one that RSS has long disowned because his organisation has no history and symbols that India can accept as its own,"" Ramesh said.

Especially so on a day when India and the Indian National Congress could celebrate the anniversary of the Quit India Movement, in which the RSS refused to participate, he said.

In a post on X on Friday, Modi said, ""As this year's Independence Day approaches, let's again make Har Ghar Tiranga a memorable mass movement. I am changing my profile picture and I urge you all to join me in celebrating our Tricolour by doing the same. And yes, do share your selfies on harghartiranga.com.""",Left
742,742," , European Central Bank policy makers expect a difficult discussion at the next monetary policy meeting in June over whether to start slowing their emergency bond-buying program, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations., While the Governing Council’s session this week was calm, resulting in no change to policy, talks on June 10 will be much more complicated and could be heated, the officials said, asking not to be identified., Some members are ready to argue that the pandemic emergency purchase program should start being scaled back in the third quarter as the economy is likely to stage a strong recovery from the pandemic in the second half of the year. That would keep the total size of bond-buying within the 1.85 trillion euros ($2.2 trillion) currently envisaged., Others want a more cautious approach that doesn’t commit the ECB to staying within that amount, giving it more freedom to respond to any further economic weakness., An ECB spokesman declined to comment. Italian bonds reversed gains on the report, pushing 10-year yields up one basis point to a day-high 0.77%, ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Thursday after the latest policy decision that the matter hasn’t been formally discussed because it would be “premature.”, The central bank has so far spent almost 1 trillion euros under the pandemic program. It decided in March to ramp up the pace of buying “significantly” to shield the region from higher global borrowing costs that are spilling over from the faster U.S. recovery., Since then, net purchases have averaged 17 billion euros a week, a figure that likely understates the actual pace due to this month’s Easter holidays, from about 14 billion euros a week at the start of the year., Some officials argued at the March meeting for an even faster pace of purchases, the officials said. On Thursday, the ECB said it’ll keep buying at current levels through the end of this quarter., Should it opt to maintain that pace for the next quarter as well, policy makers will face a difficult choice later this year. They can either taper purchases quite steeply to ensure the program stays within the current size, risking market volatility, or they can choose to extend and expand the program again., That makes June a key meeting, and the nascent signs of tension threaten to reopen longstanding differences of opinion within the Governing Council over how much monetary support is appropriate for the 19-nation , ., In this crisis, economically stronger countries such as Germany and France have relied on resilience in the manufacturing sector to cushion the pandemic shock. For nations more reliant on tourism and services, it still isn’t clear how much activity will be able to bounce back this year., Dutch central-bank Governor Klaas Knot recently argued that the ECB could begin a gradual phasing out of emergency purchases in the third quarter if current expectations for the rebound are confirmed., Asked about that proposal in her press conference on Thursday, Lagarde said that the ECB will next determine the pace of purchases in June, when it has updated economic projections., ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Center
1382,1382,"Cut out of Ram temple inauguration, Advani and Joshi deserve no sympathy
While I dislike Modi utterly, that feeling of schadenfreude also includes satisfaction that the insult to Advani is coming from none other than Modi, who was his protègè             I do not know if ‘schadenfreude’ is how I can describe the feeling of utter satisfaction I have today about LK Advani and Dr Murli Manohar Joshi getting the cold shoulder from their own party and being left out of the  Ram temple inauguration ceremonies in Ayodhya next month. It's hardly an exaggeration to say that these two characters, who presided over the demolition of the  Babri Masjid, are the original carriers of the Hindutva virus that seems to have colonised our democracy today.

Narendra Modi I look upon as a believer who really does not know what he is doing — in every aspect of governance, destroying democracy, our social fabric, and tanking the economy. But Advani and Joshi? Here are two stories from two press conferences they held in Mumbai in the aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition.

First, Dr Joshi. It was the Mumbai media’s first exposure to him, and curiosity was rife about what kind of doctor he was. “Oh, I am a PhD in physics from Allahabad University. And I can tell you there is no greater satisfaction than seeing matter broken down to the smallest atom in the laboratory.”


He quoted a Sanskrit shloka which demonstrated this principle of physics, to tell us how everything was linked to the other and dependent on each other for full realisation of potential. No one in the room understood the shloka, and looking at our blank faces he said, “ Oh well. I will simplify it for you with a saying from the Bible. It says, ‘From ashes we have come and to dust we shall return’. That is what matter and atom are all about.”                   Now Mumbai journalists were rather more inquisitive than the media entourage from Delhi that Joshi and Advani always carried with them to events in Mumbai. They asked only the weakest of questions, and their main job seemed to be to prevent the inquisitiveness of Mumbai’s reporters from getting their benefactors into trouble.

After a few seconds of stunned silence at Joshi’s answer, one journalist asked the question that was bothering all of us. “If this is what you think, Dr Joshi, then what is this difference that you are making between Hindus and Muslims and other communities? By your theory, aren’t we all one?”


Taken aback by the directness of the question, Joshi’s reply was spontaneous. “Oh, this is what I (he stressed the ‘I’) believe. That is for public consumption!”

Instantly, another saying from the Bible came to my mind, and I thought this man should never be forgiven, for he knows exactly what he is doing.  

But Advani topped the hypocrisy of Joshi, who was at least honest about his beliefs. At his press conference a few weeks later, Advani did not step back from insulting Mahatma Gandhi, who was the antithesis of the RSS and never had a divisive bone in his body.

The Western press had just taken to calling the BJP a 'Hindu nationalist party', and Advani said he was happy about that because when Gandhiji had died, the Western press had described him as the greatest Hindu nationalist leader who had ever lived. He was convinced that soon, the world would be looking at the BJP as they had at Gandhi, and it would also be seen as 'secular' and 'inclusive'.               Now here is where it got intense between me and Advani. As no Mumbai reporter challenged the sophistry, unlike at Joshi’s press conference, I jumped to my feet to ask, “Forgive me for not understanding your statement, Mr Advani. Did you just say Gandhiji was the greatest Hindu leader of this country? Now this event happened before I was born and I have read about it only in history books. So I would like to know, if you really think Gandhi was the greatest Hindu leader, how do you justify RSS involvement in the assassination of that ‘greatest Hindu leader' when it calls itself a Hindu organisation? Can we expect more such killings of Hindu leaders from the RSS?""


There was a thunderous silence before the BJP’s Mumbai spokesperson rushed to me and tried to remove me from the room. But I had one more question and I got that in. Advani had been referring to the  Babri Masjid as a ‘structure’ throughout the press conference and I asked, “Isn’t it a fact that the ‘structure’ you refer to was actually a mosque? If you had perceived it as anything other than a mosque, as a school, a hospital, or even a toilet, you would not have brought it down. Had Gandhiji been alive today, that greatest Hindu leader would never have allowed it.”

As Advani turned red (I admit I was rather direct), the press conference broke up even as I was hustled out. But that run-in hit the headlines the next day. 

“Why are you so adamant on bringing our skeletons out of the cupboard?” one spokesperson asked, even as another threatened to get me out of my job. My editor came to my rescue when I narrated the incident and the threat to me. Tickled pink by the entire story, he said, “I was looking for a good anchor this evening. This is great. Write it down for me exactly as you have narrated it.”

“But they are threatening to have me fired from my job!” I protested.

“Reporting the truth is your job. Deciding on policy is mine. You go ahead and write it. Leave the rest to me.” 


I did, and have been unwelcome on BJP portals ever since.

And Modi’s vindictiveness against the media that we talk so much about today? Well, when Advani became Union home minister, the then Maharashtra home minister told me he had received a note from Delhi asking them to keep an eye on me. ""Advani is still smarting at how you took him on at the press conference and your editor would simply not relent to the BJP over terminating your employment. So please be careful in future.”

As unbelievable as I found that vindictiveness over one question, I believe it is Advani who sowed the seeds of everything that is happening with Muslims and the media in the country today. Modi has only amplified that and used technology to greater effect than Advani. And while I dislike Modi utterly, that feeling of schadenfreude also includes satisfaction that the insult to Advani is coming from none other than Modi, who was his protègè.              Modi is showing no gratitude to Advani for having saved his job as Gujarat chief minister after the 2002 riots, against all efforts by then prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to hold him responsible for the bloodshed. Had Advani not done that — again for selfish interests because he needed Modi to win from Gandhinagar — Modi would never have made it to the office of prime minister or been in a position to destroy the country. Or even deprive Advani of the fruits of his labour, eating them himself.

So I believe it is poetic justice that Advani, who lived by the Hindutva sword, is now being cut down by the same sword. He will not be at the  Ram temple inauguration. Perhaps the gods themselves have denied him entry for spilling innocent blood for personal and political gains?",Left

848,848,"Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar Wednesday frowned upon the recalcitrance shown by his Agriculture Minister Sudhakar Singh, who belongs to the RJD, but sought to put the ball in the court of his deputy Tejashwi Yadav, the party's de facto leader.

Talking to reporters, Kumar, who is the de facto JD(U) chief, confirmed having met poll strategist-turned-activist Prashant Kishor the previous day but insisted that the meeting was ""normal and not of any political significance"".

""I had tried to enquire from him (Sudhakar) about his grievances. Instead of replying, he stormed out,"" said Kumar when asked about reports of the agriculture minister having created a scene at the cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Sudhakar Singh, whose father Jagadanand Singh is the state RJD president, had spoken about rampant corruption at a public meeting in Kaimur district a couple of days ago.

The minister, who is said to be upset with bureaucrats in his department, has reportedly threatened to resign upon being admonished by the chief minister for the embarrassing situation in which the government has landed.

Senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi has issued a statement claiming that Kumar was no longer his earlier assertive self and was unable to crack the whip out of ""fear"" of RJD.

When Kumar was asked about Singh's contention that he would stick to whatever he has said, the longest-serving chief minister of the state said ""Please ask deputy CM sahib (Tejashwi)"".

The JD(U) leader, who has been working on forging opposition unity since quitting the NDA last month, refused to share details of his meeting with Prashant Kishor.

""It was a normal meeting. There was not much to it. He was brought along by Pavan Varma who had met me a couple of days earlier too,"" Kumar said.

The chief minister said he shares an ""old relationship"" with Kishor and denied harbouring any bitterness towards the strategist whom he had berated in Delhi earlier this month. Kishor had been caustic in his response.

Kumar parried questions by scribes on whether plans were afoot to bring back Kishor into his camp by saying ""Please ask him. I have nothing more to add on the issue"".

When Kishor was contacted, he said he was away in the remote West Champaran district as part of his ""Jan Suraaj"" campaign.

He had worked in a professional capacity for Kumar in the 2015 assembly polls and upon the victory of the 'Mahagathbandhan', he was rewarded with the post of an adviser to the chief minister with the rank of a cabinet minister.

The IPAC founder subsequently got busy managing poll campaigns of other parties in other states until his induction into JD(U) in 2018 by Kumar, who was then the national president of the party.

He was elevated to the post of its national vice-president in a few weeks, but was expelled along with Varma, then a national general secretary of JD(U), for striking notes of discord on the CAA-NPR-NRC controversy.

Kishor has admitted in media interviews that a few months ago when he met Kumar in Delhi he was given an ""offer"" to revamp JD(U), details of which he would not share.

Kishor's uncharitable assessment of the latest volte-face by Kumar had led the latter to remark that the former strategist, who had in 2014 managed the spectacularly successfully poll campaign of Narendra Modi, then the BJP prime ministerial candidate, might be batting for the saffron party.

1623,1623,"  The Budget for each year is essentially a statement of income and expenditure of the Government.  However, with the expansion of the Indian economy, it has acquired the role of a policy document.  The Budget presented by the Finance Minister, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, is a policy document for the medium term. It is a budget of a continuing government, which has to accelerate the direction of the past.   It expands the roadmap on which the Prime Minister has built up India’s growth story from 2014-19.  The striking part of this period was that for a five year average, India grew by 7.3%, it’s revenues grew exponentially and it brought macro stability back with both the Current Account Deficit and the Fiscal Deficit being on the glide path downwards.  The present Budget maintains that path based on the premise that economies which are fiscally prudent, eventually get rewarded as against those who indulge in fiscal adventurism. 

          A fundamental question has always been asked as to what would one choose between good economics and clever politics.  The choice is unfair because any Government needs both in order to survive and perform.  The Prime Minister’s first tenure witnessed this blending of good economics and good politics.  The change, which was facilitated by the Jan Dhan Accounts and the AADHAAR, laid the foundation for Direct Benefit Transfer to those who needed State support.  Subsidies were no longer an unknown amount of money being distributed to an unidentifiable class of people.  Subsidies in the form of transfer of facilities to the poor is an example of the blending of good economics and good politics.  The villages get roads, the poor get houses, and every household got a toilet, a gas connection and an electricity connection.  Fifty crore people got hospital treatment upto Rs.5 lakh per year.  Their lives became liveable with at least these basics.  To carry this path forward, completion of the rural housing being constructed and delivered to the poor, and the conclusion of the remaining part of the gas connection programme, the Budget takes upon itself the task of concentrating, in the next five years, on a ‘tap for every home’.  For this, it is necessary to clean up our rivers and have an adequate water management. 

          The last five years had seen a lot of emphasis on infrastructure.  The Finance Minister has rightly given top priority to infrastructure.  This priority is self-evident in the fact that the rural roads programme connecting every village with a motorable road is nearing completion.  The National Highways are moving at a pace faster than ever before.  Adequate amount of allocations have been made in the Budget for this.  The railways is one of the top priorities of the Government.  Besides faster trains, modernised coaches, additional railway safety measures, very soon India will witness the modernisation of its railway stations similar to what today has happened to the airports.  Increase in port capacity, further development of inland water transportation and expanding the aviation sector to the remotest corner of the country is the roadmap which the Finance Minister has presented.  This will be the India of 2024.

          Modernisation of our cities with all-weather roads, an effective metro system, better urban roads are being given an impetus.  The Government is committed to providing housing to the weaker sections in both rural and urban areas.  A major tax incentive has been given to those who borrow to buy affordable houses.  This move will not merely help the system to utilise the unsold stock of affordable houses but will also be instrumental in injecting liquidity into the real estate market. 

          The direction of reforms in the banking and financial sector has been maintained.  Consolidation of public sector banks is being undertaken so as to have fewer but mega and financially strong banks.  A sizeable allocation has been made for recapitalisation of banks so that their capacity to lend for growth improves.  The Budget contains concrete proposals about support to the NBFCs whose liquidity, for the last several months, was under strain and had reduced the purchasing power of consumer.  The sectors most affected by this were real estate, automobiles and the MSMEs.    

          While the GST reforms are being carried out by the GST Council, a lot of simplification for direct tax assesses has been proposed.  Besides affordable housing, electric vehicles and start-ups are the sectors on which the Budget places an adequate emphasis.  In the last two years, when the global crude oil prices had hardened, duties had been cut by the Central Government on at least two occasions in a major way.  It is the softening of the crude oil prices which has persuaded the Government to raise the excise duty on petrol and diesel marginally so that this money could be transferred to a special fund meant for infrastructure creation, particularly for the National Highways and the rural roads programme. 

          The Budget creates a political direction for an aspirational India.  The economically weaker sections get the basic amenities of life.  Besides the income-tax exemption limit having been increased to rupees five lakhs in the interim Budget a few months ago, several sectors of interest to the middle class and the neo-middle class have been incentivised.  These, in particular, include affordable housing and electric vehicles. Massive infrastructure creation also has the ability to generate employment and attract investment.  So does a boost to the construction and real estate sector.  India will continue to be the fastest growing major economy in the world.  In the last two to three quarters growth has seen a moderation. Unquestionably, the Budget as a policy document lays down the roadmap for India to get back on track. ",Right
84,84,"“Modi is not Our Enemy, We are His ……..”, says Swami Avimukteshwaranand                                 Swami Avimukteshwaranand, the Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath, expressed strong opposition to the construction of a Kedarnath Temple in Delhi. The spiritual leader shared his views while visiting Mumbai for Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s ‘Shubh Ashirvaad’ ceremony. This event brought together influential figures from various spheres, providing a platform for the Swami to voice his opinions on recent developments.                      During his Mumbai visit, the Swami encountered both Prime Minister Modi and former Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. These interactions highlighted the complex relationships between spiritual leaders and politicians in India’s diverse landscape.                                        Modi and the Swami
The ascetic blessed Modi, stating, “We bless all who approach us. Modi is not our foe; we’re his well-wishers.” He added that they point out Modi’s mistakes when necessary. This approach demonstrates the Swami’s balanced stance towards the Prime Minister, offering both support and constructive criticism.

Uddhav’s Struggle
Regarding Uddhav, the Swami sympathized with his political setback. After visiting Uddhav’s residence ‘Matoshree’, he remarked, “A great betrayal has befallen Uddhav. Our pain will persist until he regains his Chief Minister position.” This statement underscores the Swami’s support for Uddhav in the face of recent political upheavals.

Uddhav’s Political Journey
Uddhav’s tenure as Chief Minister ended abruptly on June 30, 2022, following Eknath Shinde’s rebellion. Shinde, along with most Shiv Sena MLAs, formed a new government with BJP’s support. This political shift dramatically altered Maharashtra’s political landscape, leaving Uddhav and his supporters in a challenging position.

Recent Developments
However, recent Lok Sabha polls saw setbacks for Shinde’s alliance, potentially boosting Uddhav’s prospects in upcoming state elections. These results suggest a possible shift in public sentiment, which could influence future political alignments in Maharashtra.

Swami’s Stance on Kedarnath Temple
The Shankaracharya strongly opposed the Kedarnath temple project in Delhi. He stated, “Kedarnath Temple can’t be replicated in Delhi. The 12 Jyotirlinga have fixed locations. This move is incorrect.” This stance reflects a traditionalist view on the sanctity of religious sites and their geographical significance.

Background on Kedarnath Project
On July 10, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami participated in a bhoomi puja for the new Kedarnath temple in Delhi’s Hiranki neighborhood. This event marked the official start of the controversial project, which has since drawn criticism from various quarters.

Allegations of Gold Scam
Swami Avimukteshwaranand raised concerns about a potential gold scam at Kedarnath. He claimed, “228 kg of gold is missing from Kedarnath. Why isn’t anyone addressing this issue?” The ascetic demanded an investigation, warning against potential misuse of funds in the Delhi project.

Implications of the Allegations
These allegations, if proven true, could have significant implications for both the original Kedarnath shrine and the proposed Delhi project. The Swami’s call for an inquiry highlights the need for transparency in religious and governmental affairs.

Modi and Uddhav: Contrasting Political Fortunes
The Swami’s interactions with both Modi and Uddhav underscore the shifting political dynamics in India. While Modi continues to hold significant influence at the national level, Uddhav faces challenges in regaining his former position in Maharashtra.

Looking Ahead
As Maharashtra prepares for upcoming elections, the support of spiritual leaders like Swami Avimukteshwaranand could play a crucial role in shaping public opinion. Uddhav’s political future may depend on his ability to leverage such support and capitalize on recent setbacks faced by his opponents.

Conclusion
The Swami’s statements highlight the intersection of spirituality and politics in India. His blessings for Modi, support for Uddhav, and opposition to the Delhi Kedarnath project reflect the complex dynamics at play. As the political landscape evolves, the Shankaracharya’s words may influence public opinion and political strategies in the coming months.

The controversy surrounding the Delhi Kedarnath Temple project, coupled with allegations of financial impropriety, adds another layer of complexity to an already intricate political scenario. As these events unfold, the roles of spiritual leaders, politicians, and public opinion will continue to shape India’s religious and political narrative.",Center
